I'm going to turn $100 into a $1,000,000
Jul 14, 2024

no I am not going to stop trading a couple of days ago I posted on my Instagram that I was thinking about stopping trading because I have pretty much achieved everything that I wanted from it it became very boring very systematical and I just thought I was done with it and I wanted to focus on something else different type of markets but then I realized that I can't stop trading because there's this one thing I haven't achieved and this one thing has been haunting me ever since I haven't completed it for the last 8 n months literally thinking about it every single day how I let myself down and you guys and that is the 100 to the mail challenge in August 6th of 2023 I started my first attempt to turning a $100 into a million dollar little did I know what challenges this had ahead of me and this was the challenge the series The Daily battles that literally turned me into the trader that I am today I learned so much over the course of these 3 to four months where I successfully flipped $100 all the way to $360,000 but it got to the point where I started hating trading I didn't love the journey I didn't feel the same about it because I was almost just forcing it it got to the point where I just wanted to get the challenge out of the way and I was getting tired of trading London session New York session every single day because I had a very hard schedule and I had so much stuff going around at the time I had just moved into a new house there were so many things attacking at the same time that I wasn't really doing the challenge Cheng for myself I was just doing it because I decided to start something that nobody has ever done and as I started it I didn't realize the battles that I was going to face and I didn't realize how much pressure I was going to be under and I'm not the kind of person to ever quit on anything and I wasn't just going to stop halfway through it and I actually never opened up and said this before but I wanted to stop the challenge as soon as I got to 100K the fact that I turned $100 to $100,000 was absolutely insane to me but I saw the love and the feedback that you guys gave to me and I said you know what I can't stop here I had to keep going and that's where more stress came in and it just started turning more into a hate relationship versus love relationship that I would have with the markets and all of these battles and all of these things that I faced is something that now I am ready for it because I have already experienced it I learned from it and now when I'm going to begin this new 100 to the mill challenge I know exactly what I'm going to be facing and for those of you guys that have no idea what I'm talking about about a year ago I tried to take $100 to a million dollar and I documented every single trade before I took it as soon as I took it and after I took it I shared every single trade on my Instagram telegram live streams I was literally showing you guys how all you need is the proper skill set in order to succeed in trading you don't need a large amount of capital in order to actually make money from Trading once you learn the skill set the money that you can make from Trading is literally as much as you want and one of the main things that I learned in this journey of my first attempt to the 100 to the mail because keep in mind never previously in my life have I ever done a successful flip now I've maybe turned 10,000 to 30 40,000 or a couple thousand to maybe 10,000 but never something so exponential I taken something as small as $100 to then six figures so this is my actual first attempt to doing it and I got so much awareness and so much love from all of you guys the series alone got millions of views that I said I can't let the people down I have I have to keep this going but as I kept it going I got to the point where it pretty much broke me that I even had to leave social media and take a little of a break because the pressure was insane and you know looking back at all that stuff that I went to I realized that I just wasn't ready for it and the fact that I actually made it to that far was pretty much impressive because it was my first time actually doing it now fast forward a year later I am a completely different person I'm older more experienced and now I am 100% ready to take on this 100 to the m and all the mistakes that I made I haven't written down and I learned from them one of the main ones is going to be look out for the news when I actually trade I never look for news and when trading the account on the last days of it before I actually blew it it's because I got caught in between an NFP news which are the main news that happen at the beginning of the first Friday of every month now I have that calendarized and I know exactly what to look out for and those days that I'm going to be trading I'm going to make sure to either minimize my risk or simply not trade second is going to be to not travel and trade so I've traveled literally all around the world right before I'm starting this challenge so I can literally lock in dial in and only focus on the challenge because I was actually trading outside of my home office because they were doing renovations in my house and I couldn't focus because they were pretty much breaking down a bathroom and one of the closets so I had to go and stay at an apartment building in the city and I just was out of my comfort zone and you add news on top of that it was just pretty much an equation for failure so those are two main things that I learned from that challenge and then the Third is I don't have to put so much pressure on myself on having those hard targets every single week my goals was to double up the account every single week no matter what and I was taking trades that I shouldn't have and luckily it all played in my favor because I was in a very good winning streak throughout the market but I didn't have to put that amount of pressure on myself because I was staying up during London session when I didn't have to and I was staying up New York session when I didn't sleep London session that would have just affected my regular day-to-day life and my work life balance come now this new challenge I'm going to do this correctly I'm going to do this so any single person out there can handedly copy every single step that I'm going to do with this 100 to the mill challenge even if you have a job even if you have all the free time in the world I'm going to make this as simple and as effective as possible so everybody can replicate it better than what I did last time this time I'm bigger stronger and better than ever and if you guys haven't seen the series turning $100 into a million is really not that difficult you just have to pretty much double your accounts every single week or every single two weeks and with compound interest and a positive risk reward of a minimum of a 1 to2 one to three risk reward you can successfully flip the account all the way up to a million or even past a million the only highrisk thing is that you're obviously risking a lot of the account I was risking 50 to 75% of the account every single time I would to take a trade now this is not sustain aable type of trading but you start off with 100 bucks once you're at 20,000 and say you risk half of that it's not a big deal it's not your money technically it's profits from the market so I wasn't attached to the money I was more attached to the stress and the journey that I was kind of putting you guys to it because what I would record I would document it and show it you guys and I don't want to transmit stress because trading shouldn't be that way trading should be something that is done seamlessly when you follow a trading plan and a system and just to add a little bit more and go a little bit deeper into the subject the art of flipping an account is simply taking the highest probability trade you don't want to take a bunch of little trades in order to flip an account that's not the goal you don't want to take a bunch of different trades and see which one hits and see which ones don't you simply want to wait when you have a really really really really really good trade setup and you pretty much just risk everything on that trade now if you wait 5 6 7 8 n days for one trade to appear and everything checks out on it the odds of it winning are higher than not so why would you not bet 5050 to 60% of the account obviously if you're with a flip account mindset I don't do this with my personal account I don't do this with any other ones of my accounts I only do this when I'm flipping it and I've actually been you know flipping a little bit of the accounts over the course of the last two three months just to see if I still have it and I definitely still have it I've successfully flipped many different accounts and it leads me to this point to just confirm that all you need for a successful flip is going to be to wait for a really really good trade setup that would consist of multiple time frames in sync a strong level of area of interest and a very very strategic and positive entry signal is going to be key to when you go risk 50 to 60% of your account on this trade the odds of you winning are a lot higher versus losing whenever you execute this trade you want to make sure you have a minimum of a three risk to reward 1 to two 1 to three so that 50% of the account that you risk now you are up technically 150% 200% of the account obviously when you're talking 100 bucks two3 $400 it's really not much when you take that same percentage to then 10,000 so then 50,000 then 100,000 then you start growing really really really fast and the Arts of flipping is not being attached to the money because if you can flip an account from 100 to 200 that's just one flip there's no difference in percentage wise taking 10,000 to 20,000 20,000 to 40,000 40 to 80 it's all the same percentage don't even that changes is the numbers on the screen and you have to be very experienced and very nonchalant and stoic to not let that affect you and that is what I was not prepared previously in The Challenge from com out to this challenge I give a about the money all I care about is achieving this and showing you guys that it is possible for you guys to do it so now coming into this new 100 to thee Mill challenge part two there is nothing that I'm going to change in my strategy my strategy is exactly the same my risk is going to be exactly the same the type of markets that I trade are going to be exactly the same there's only couple things that are going to change and there's a couple of rules that I'm going to be implementing which are going to be the following the first is every single trade that I'm going to take just as before I have to share across my whole entire social media so all of you guys can follow along and see the trade for yourselves the second is going to be that I can only trade in the Foreign Exchange Market I cannot trade cryptos which are going crazy right now and I can't trade any stocks or options I have to stick to my foreign exchange markets and nothing outside of that and then third is that I cannot take any signals anybody else's bias anybody it's just my trade analysis and nobody else's previously I was looking at some of my students analysis and it kind of affected a little bit me even though I didn't pay attention to it just subconsciously got in my mind but now in this challenge I'm only going to focus on my trades and nobody else's trades and just to assure of that I am going to be personally sending the trades out in my Instagram in my Telegram in my Discord so you guys can have the exact same Journey as me it's going to be crazy because this is as transparent as it gets and nobody has ever done this before and honestly I'm more confident than ever that I could achieve this simply because I'm starting right around the same time that I did last year meaning that the market should have that winning streak that I had come last year and on top of that I I'm just ready I can almost feel it I can see the markets lining up I've practiced it in the last two three months with a little bit bigger accounts and I've successfully done it and I've actually looked back through the whole entire series of me turning the $100 to the mill and I would literally see days that I would be emotional days that I wouldn't be emotional I would spot the mistakes in myself my trading was absolutely impeccable the trades were perfect the risk management was perfect takeprofit stop loss everything was perfect but the Trader that was executing that strategy at that time wasn't the trader that was meant for that success I believe the trader that I am now I am two three even four times bigger than who I was just a year ago in terms of mindset and experience that now I'm more confident than ever that I could achieve this and the accounts that I have been previously flipping has been with the markets that I have analyzed with my students every single week that I do on Sunday swings and literally two weeks ago I did a free Sunday swings for the first time here in my YouTube channel and we got over a 100,000 people that tuned in to the stream where we had a beautiful beautiful Market line up on Sunday and it ended up playing out by Wednesday that was a trade that I actually made $200,000 on and all the hundreds of thousands of traders that got on the stream they actually saw it live so I'm going to be doing maybe a free SUNY swings every month or every month and a half the only way for you to find out is if you hit that subscribe button and turn on the notification Bell because not only are you going to be part of this Legend legendary series of attempting to turn $100 into a million once again but you're going to be part of a free live stream that I'm going to be sharing with you the markets before they happen a

I Tried to turn $100 Into $200 in a Week Trading Forex
Jul 21, 2024

so the account is not looking that good right now you guys can see that we are currently down about $32 on the account ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry to announce that I'm going to try and turn these $100 into a million and we got to hurry up because the market is officially open 9:45 on Monday and we already have the account ready to go so obviously with one go you can't turn $100 into a million so this is how I'm going to do it so I'm going to be doing it one week at a time so week one is to turn $10000 week 2 200 400 week 3 400 800 and pretty much scale every single week like that that is going to be key to have the compound interest grow with the account because with one shot 100 to a million it's imposs so we slowly have to scale the account but the goal is to actually double up the account every single week as I tried this last time and failed and if I double up correctly every single week according to my calculations we should be at a million in about three and a half to 4 months if I use a minimum of a 1 to2 risk reward and I stick to 1 to two trads but this all going to make sense in just a second and to guarantee my success in this Challenge and not blow it like the last one I've set some rules in place and these rules are the following and the first is going to be that I can only trade the Foreign Exchange Market I cannot trade the stock market crypto Market none of those only the Foreign Exchange Market second is that every single trade that I take I have to publicly share with you guys in my free telegram on my Instagram Discord YouTube here with you guys absolutely everywhere so you guys can see the trades real time the before the during and the after and you guys can capitalize off these trades with me and then the third is that I cannot use anybody else's traits I can only use my own analysis using my own strategy I cannot use any signal providers anybody in my community nobody only my analysis to get this Challenge and succeed and with that being said let the challenge begin all right so we got to get right into this because we are currently late so yesterday it was actually my birthday so well right now it's 9:54 in the morning Monday morning woke up a little bit late because it was my birthday yesterday so I officially now 24 I'm no longer young now I feel old as [ __ ] but doesn't matter let's get right into this market right here so we're going to start off the challenge on GBP JPY so actively right now for this week we only have one two three and four pairs of Interest obviously I analyze a bunch of different markets you guys can see right here I pretty much analyze all of these markets when I pretty much look for the opportunities for the week ahead but I only found good opportunities in four markets for this week so the first one is going to be GBP JPY so this is currently what the 4our time frame looks like and it's giving me a very clear indication of a reversal pattern So currently right now this is the daily time frame as you guys can see up here to the top top left corner uh and this is currently having a very clear bullish move to the upside we've had very clean higher lows and then a very big higher high if you look at this on the weekly time frame you can see that we are now flicking over to the weekly time frame we've had a very high move and then a weekly dogee usually what happens after a very strong push is then you're going to have a retracement now this trade that we're about to take and it sucks that we're about to start The Challenge on something like this is a counter Trend trade this is a red flag this is a no because you want to be trading with the trend but I don't know if because I analyzed the markets two weeks ago before I decided to start this Challenge and they were great and come this week and there's not that many great opportunities but it's okay we can still actually make money cuz we're going to follow the trading plan so you can clearly see how the daily time frame has then shifted bearish and then how the 4H hour time frame which is this one right here we are creating what looks to be like a head and the shoulders pattern so this head and shoulders pattern has very clear done a reversal now the only way I would look to sell is if we retest this level of resistance and support again clearly whenever we're under we're selling whenever we're above we're buying and whenever we're under we are selling so I just want price to have a pull back into here again to then head to the downside so that is the first pair GBP JPY this is my second pair it is going to be gbpusd so gbpusd currently right now on the daily time frame is looking like a very strong higher high push so you can see this Market has had a very very strong push to the upside now the key that you want to do with this is you want to continue to buy but in order for you to continue buying with this you are then to have need a deeper pull back into here to then head to the upside but this deeper pullback you can actually trade that against the trend now it's not ideal I repeat it highrisk trade I don't want to do it but we're obviously taking highrisk trades on this $100 account to then flip it and it's what it's what the opportunity the market is giving us currently right now because if not I would probably not trade this week by the way the market is looking and I do want to get involved and if I could find a good probability trade setup remember the key to flipping this account is going to be to only finding really really really really good probability trade setups so we go down to the and well back to the Daily time frame you can see this daily time frame that line right there if I were to look left you can see how it is a very well respected level of resistance all throughout here so you see very strong level of support and then used as resistance so when I go down to the 1H hour time frame 1 hour time frame we have a very strong accumulation level at that resistance point so the only way I would actually trade this is if we were to have a break retest out of that zone so that is going to confirm to us that the daily time frame has had the higher high and now we are going to potentially have that retracement and if the 1 hour breaks out of this consolidation box it's going to confirm to me that we are then going to have this pullback for then the daily time frame so this is what it would look like on the daily it would look like one big pullback but on the 1 hour there's going to be opportunities on the lower time frame you know we got to see things for the future next is going to be Euro GBP so Euro GBP currently right now we have had a very strong bearish move to the downside lower low lower high lower low and we are now under this level of support now we're going to be using it as resistance daily time frame we have clearly broken under this level of support and now we're pretty much just waiting for it to use it as resistance so we're literally waiting for this trade right here this is a trade that we actually missed last week and this is a beautiful l left head right shoulder retested the neckline and then sell the trade did not activate our entry by one and a half Pips because we just simply didn't have it so sucks it is what it is that trade what we do is since we did not execute it what we do is we just remove it so right now what we are waiting for on Euro gvp on the 4 Hour so you can see that we're on the 4 Hour up here we are then going to actually wait for a pull back into this level we're going to wait for price to have a pull back to here so then we we can actually head to the downside so you're gvp just waiting for a 4H hour pullback have to be patient and then lastly is going to be GBP CAD so this is currently GBP CAD if you notice we're literally trading the Great British pound throughout the whole entire week because it's the markets that are giving me the best opportunities so same thing as gbpusd the great uh GBP CAD is at a very strong higher high and if you notice whenever the market has a strong higher high push it has a retracement strong higher high push retracement now we have a really strong higher high push we are destined for that retracement so what I'm going to wait for is any indications on that reversal and I'm then going to enter the trade so now we're on the 1 hour time frame on GBP Cad and what I'm going to be waiting for is for price to then have a break and retest under this structure level right here going to be waiting for a break and retest in order to actually enter this trade isz then it confirms that it's shifting out of this bullish move to then head to the downside so everything we got this week so far is a counter Trend trade except your GBP but all we got to do is just be patient and uh if we blow the account just do it again oh and this time we're not [ __ ] around we got four phones this time 1 two 3 four phones to literally track everything for you guys my FX book once again it's Monday morning currently 10: in the morning and then you guys can see the account is currently at $100 let the challenge begin [Music] holy [ __ ] I hate egg so we just finished Sunday Swings with the guys and one of the guys actually told me I was just reading right now in the Discord that literally two of the markets that I started off the challenge with last year in the last challenge are the same markets that I started off this year so I want to go make sure and see of that right now just going to cook some eggs first chef is not here anymore now we got to cook ourselves we might get a new Chef very very very soon I literally had to come and watch this so look 11 months ago you can clearly see this guy right here which by the way I don't know who this guy is or who he thinks he is wearing three chains look at him bro who did I think I was wearing three chains I look at these videos like cringe cuz I not that person anymore but you can see right here in the markets actually so the first two pairs were actually GBP Cad and gbpusd for this time around literally a year later when we're doing the challenge it's actually the second pair and then the third pair which is actually pretty crazy oh and by the way I have to show you guys the my effect book account you guys can see right here so this is the 100 to the mill accounts we are I'm just hiding it so you guys can see that it is clearly a real account so this is where we're pretty much going to track everything on this account and I forgot as was watching the 100 to the mill series I'm like wait I have the account but I haven't connected it to my fbook so we just did that right now so with that being said let's see where today takes us all right so right now trade update damn that's crazy that I'm saying that right now trade update that feels good I haven't said that in a long time right now it's currently 3:35 in the afternoon markets are slow haven't really moved so right now we're going to go hit the gym the Cyber truck so got to do some h r [ __ ] all right so what I was saying is there's something different that I want to do with this challenge is keep a perfect balance not be I don't want to get drained I don't want to get burnt out of the challenge so what I'm going to do is actually stay in my routine doing my business meetings go to the gym go out before what I would do I would just stay up 24/7 throughout the whole week and I was burnt out the weekends I would just catch up on sleep and then do it again in the last Challenge and that's probably the main reason why I was burnt out and blew it this time that is not going to happen I'm going to get shredded during this challenge cuz it's also a financial challenge but a physical challenge because I really do think that I can get to the best Point I've ever physically been in my life so that's where we're going to be hitting the gym cardio doing everything the challenge for the 100 100 to the mill just a little cherry on [Music] top so I have a theory right every single time I am going to go eat at a restaurant first of all I need a chef badly because I hate ordering food and I hate cooking I just need a chef but now we got to improvise and this guy behind the camera eats a thousand times more than I do so I got to order for 10 for this guy but I have a theory right if you're going to go eat at a new restaurant just order everything on the menu don't order one thing because let's say you don't like that one thing then you got to go back and then let's say you go back and then you don't like that other thing again you just wasted two trips to a place that you never liked I'm not that guy I'm the guy that I will order everything in one shot so I'm going to get right now a juice a pizza a tuna tartar one kinoa rice one panini sandwich another kinoa cuz [ __ ] it right so I'm going literally just try a little bit of everything and then if I like it well then I go back if I don't like it I never go back all right so food just got here we're very strategic with it we order the Uber Eats on the way home because as soon as we get here you know traffic food gets here same time genius so we got whatever this is what the [ __ ] is this bro what is that bro I would never eat that I didn't know the bone was black I would have known I would have picked it you have something against black buns um not necessarily well that doesn't look that attractive here Panini I don't know explain this to me sat the chips this right here was $25 we got to go run later we got to burn this out [Music] every day jog minimum 20 minutes trying to lose this right here and the only way to sweat that piece out is by running this sucks hey you got to do what you got to do all right so we just got back from the jog currently right now it is 10:00 at night and you guys can see the first notification right here is a GB py alert so what I do is strategically I set my alert at an area of Interest where I'm looking to enter the trade so then I can actually execute it so this actually happened 40 minutes ago this literally happened as soon as we left for the jog which is annoying because I wasn't notified 40 minutes ago I go now to trading view which we can come here and check it out you guys can see how currently we are pulling up to that zone right now so right now what I'm going to do is shower and then I'm I'm going to pretty much get ready to enter this trade cuz I think it might be ready tonight I think we're going to enter the first trade tonight bro on the first day on the first day yeah I know it's kind of crazy um but I'm not in a rush as you can tell last time what I would be doing I would ler be like running up the stairs to go take a trade I know this is not going to move within the next 2 3 hours because it's 10:00 London session starts around 2: to 3: in the morning here so there won't be any volume until then so now I'm just going to shower I'm out here just waiting for the sweat to dry up a little bit if we ran I got I got a I got a [ __ ] so now we're tracking our performance with our health and our sleep I'm going to show you guys cuz bro last time that [ __ ] was bad I was sleeping like 2 3 hours now I'm going to literally show you guys working out and I am actively up to date with the health health is everything if your health is good money will come if you're consistent with the gym you'll be consistent with the [ __ ] that you got to do to get money so we'll tune in probably back in in an hour you do realize this is the most important trade of the whole challenge yeah I know right the first one is the most [ __ ] important trade I'm treating it like uh cuz it is it's like I mean I I guess it is exciting but like dude we've done this already it's not our [ __ ] first time bro we got this bro you know come on all right guys so market update it is currently 1 in the morning and honestly it looks like we're going to have to trade London session tonight I took a nap earlier caught me taking a nap so it looks like I'm going might have to trade L session I don't want to do this but I'm not tired I'm not you know forcing myself St to stay up fall asleep fall asleep miss a trade no big deal let's come over here to the phones and you can see that on the Android uh it's not one in the morning cuz this time is wrong but $100 account this is the same account right here you can see it's 1:00 in the morning and then this is my fbook as well as 1:00 in the morning showing you guys the balance of the whole entire account so I'm showing you guys the tracking of the account on different phones and multiple different platforms and different types of phones so you guys can literally not have any doubts about the challenge I'm sh you guys how legit this is because seems like nobody's able to do it this legit so they actually come over here to the markets and we have GBP JPY which earlier we had the notification of price reaching our area of Interest which was this alarm right around here so price notified us that price reached to that point so now that we're here and we've had the pullback that I've been anticipating I go down to then the lower time Fram such as the 1 hour and I'm going to be looking for a bearish engulfing area at this level something like this right here this is a beautiful bearish engulfing ing Candlestick engulfing the previous one look at that beautiful move to then the downside so I'm going to be looking for price to engulf this Candlestick right here the bottom of that Candlestick if it engulfs it I'll pretty much be looking to enter the trade and then I would have my stop loss right around here and then probably my take profit right around somewhere here I would have a minimum of a 1 to two or 1 to 2.5 risk to reward ratio so let say session is probably going to start in about an hour and a half more or less if I stay up I catch it if I don't I don't it is what it is if I don't get that beish engulfing candles stick I will not enter the trade I'm going to be very patient because the first trade is pretty much the most important one it's going to get me out of the hole so I'm going to be very selective on the first trade let's go look at the other markets actually so next Market is gbpusd and you guys can see how earlier today this Market was literally at the High and the high of this Market is where we were anticipating for price to break and retest under the zone so we actually hit the bottom of that zone and we weren't able to actually retest it this is what it looks like on the daily so the daily looks like it has a very nice daily dogee which is good because this is indicating that the market has hit a high point and it has stopped the market hit a high point and it stopped now it can potentially start having a reversal so you're seeing how the market starts creating these different type of patterns where you can almost predict what's going to happen next so here you can see that we had the daily doe at the strong level of resistance and if I actually come here and this level of resistance I double tap this line this box will pop up right here and this is actually around psychological level 130,000 it's actually a little bit more above than I would anticipate but you can see right here round psychological level 130,000 or like the smart money concept guys would call it a bank Zone a order block whatever [ __ ] they want to say it's a level of support and resistance same [ __ ] so we go over here now down to the 1 hour and you can see how the 1 hour has created this strong level of support here and what we are going to literally wait for is this so as of right now we have already had the push down so I remove this leg on the push down now we just need the actual break of it so we need something like this retest and then we'll be entering the trade into the downside so GBP USD currently loading Euro gvp next we have this level of Interest right here waiting for price to have the pullback to head to the downside just simply waiting for that to then make its way and then lastly we have a GBP CAD which where go and then gvp CAD which I just found it it just got lost for whatever reason is going to be the next pair and as you can see we've had the continuous push to the upside what we were looking for mainly is on this 1 hour time frame what we were waiting for is for price to have a break and then a retest under this level here so then we can actually enter the trade to the downside so this is basically a little bit similar to gbpusd just look if you were to look at gbpusd you to look at the market here this is GBP CAD you look at gbpusd it actually already had the push GBP CAD hasn't had the push just yet so gbpusd technically ahead of it that's why I'm more interested in it so right now 1 in the morning the only trade that we're actually about to enter is GBP JPY and that Candlestick did not close engulfing so we have about 57 minutes for this next Candlestick to close I'm going to wait for it in about 57 minutes it's going to be 2:00 in the morning see if we enter the first trade s and forget if not I'll see you guys tomorrow in the morning all right guys good morning it is currently July 16th Tuesday morning so obviously we stayed up last night it's about like 3: in the morning is saas knocked out I stayed up to catch this trade and it was for no reason because let me just explain so first of all let me show you guys the marker right now so you guys can see we are currently in the position and this is literally the max that I can honestly risk on the account even if I wanted to enter a position right now it would not let me because I don't have enough leverage my leverage right now is 1 to 500 so this is the max that I can literally execute on the market which is what is that like 1.2 L so let me show you guys the market on the trade so last night remember that I explained to you guys that I was waiting for the market to have a body closure under this line right here so we had that body engulfing Candlestick and then I pretty much entered on the little quick pull back of the next one and now that was for no reason because all of London session as soon as I fell asleep literally did nothing I'm on 3 hours of sleep for oh let's show them the time currently it is 8:25 5 in the morning so what does that mean that 3 and 1/2 hours it's an amazing first day we're doing this again we're doing this again we're doing this again but the point is that now price is pulling back into the area where we entered usually what should happen is as soon as we enter the trade it just goes down with the momentum of the session but not we haven't but it is what it is enter the trade s forget my prediction is that now from here it is going to go down so this is basically what I want to show you guys here is just basically this candles look like it's pulling back into that area but we're just going to honestly set and forget next is GBP USD we had a little bit of this break right here that we were anticipating but if we were to look at it on the 4H hour which is this time frame right here we did not have that body closure under this box which really the Box should be right around here but obviously on the 1 hour it would be around this level we had the break and on the retest no engulfing Candlestick no trade that is the importance of following the trading plan you can literally stay up all night wait 3 days for the trade there's no entry no trade as of right now this was not executed because there was no opportunity and then Euro GBP we're waiting for the market to have its pull back to this area which we are still actively waiting for and then lastly gvp CAD which you've had the push all the way to the upside basically at this point we have not had the break and retest under here so we are still just actively waiting the only position that is actively live right now is GBP JPY and all we got to do at this point set and forget all right to update the time it is currently 8:27 in the morning Tuesday morning but I got it 1 minute ago positive $15 now we are about to hit Margin Call on the account 1 minute later but this trading is so funny dude oh my God all right so trade up there right now it looks so as you guys can see right here we are currently pretty much about below the accounts we're about 37% right now and uh looks like this Candlestick is making highs right now so that's a very strong 1 hour bullish engulfing Candlestick oh oh oh no yeah that's not good so if this that Candlestick closes like that in the next 20 minutes because we have 20 minutes left in this Candlestick closure we're pretty much cooked cuz then the next Candlestick would just and we're H we're not even halfway to our stop loss and we're already down pretty much a third so you know cuz you have to you have to count in spread commission and all that [ __ ] yeah if this trade goes up we're cooked but it's okay cuz guess what we just do it again it's just 100 bucks all right guys market update I'm on the camera right now Sebastian had to go do whatever he had to go do trade is looking well so this is a trade update right now so we are currently sitting at around $131 in profit and the trade has literally had a beautiful rejection from this area right here we've had a little bit of a pullback so that Candlestick did end up indeed closing engulfing but not above this structure point or that one so that was good and now we're pretty much just set and forgetting gbpusd on the other hand which was the other Market it literally had the retest on the lower time frame and then it had the push we're looking for that retest on the higher time frame it just didn't happen it happened on the lower time frame spr but the movement is actually happening Euro gvp still hasn't made it here and then GBP CAD it is waiting still for this break and retest to then head to the downside but GJ which is a trade that we are actively in right now is looking very well and then the current time right now is 12:49 p.m. so as of right now set and forget probably going to go eat right now and and then potentially hit the gym had Zoom meetings all day and then probably a little bit more zoom meetings it's the reality of my life lately just trade meetings with the guys and then DM sleep repeat fun life right sometimes it is all right guys so trade upate it is currently 4:00 in the afternoon and the trade right now currently looks like this so literally right around break even the daily Candlestick is looking like a bullish daily Candlestick 4 hours looks like some bearish rejections and then you can see right here that the trade is literally break in so stayed up got four hours of sleep for no reason but we technically are winning a trade today and we are up so today we get to drive the Ferrari the days we don't make money we drive the BR never made back the days we make money we drive the supercars cold start you ready a [Music] usually what we do is we go hit aana or run later we're going to go straight home right now and run So currently it is 5:00 in the afternoon and probably go for probably get home in like 20 25 minutes then go for about a 25 minute run running sucks is [ __ ] fat got to do what you got to do all right guys market update it is currently 10:00 at night and the markets are not looking that good the account is not looking that good but it doesn't matter we're going to set and forget throughout the whole entire night we don't have to stay up watching the market we already stayed up to enter the trade now we simply just set and forget the trade either hits our stop loss or hits our take profit so the account is not looking that good right now you guys can see that we are currently down about $32 on the account and that is because the daily time frame closes a bullish Candlestick so as you guys can see right here the daily bullish Candlestick was very strong and it engulf this previous one and the body still didn't make it to these body structures right here so this next daily Candlestick could simply go a little bit higher than the other one the 4our has had two strong bullish engulfing candlesticks which are not well this is engulfing this is just a bullish candle that is not good but what does look good is the 1 hour so the 1 hour is clearly creating accumulation and rejecting at this level we just pretty much have to set and forget what I really want from this Candlestick right here and it's what it's looking like it's doing even though it still has 53 minutes left for it to close we need this Candlestick to close like a bearish engulfing like this one so then that can then give it the movement to the downside so as right now we're currently down $35 on the challenge we just have to set and forget and then wait for the market to either go back into profit or simply blow the account next is gbpusd so gbpusd we had the little quick retest earlier but we did not have the movement to the downside because we had this pull back above the area of Interest we want to have the retest and then the rejection under this level of support and resistance then the daily time frame close as a daily doe so I always am a strong believer that these dois always get that Wick fill you see this Wick right here filled it see this Wick filled now I believe we can fill this Wick to the downside and then this is where I'm going to be waiting for a little break and retest under to actually be able to be interested in this trade so I'm going to be waiting for something like this in order for us to actually execute on this trade but obviously I cannot enter this trade because I maxed out margin on GP JPY so I can't really do much other than just let the other trade play out but just updating you guys on what the markets are doing lastly the rgbp is now on its way to the area of Interest we haven't quite made it there yet so there's nothing that we can do and then GBP CAD if you guys look at it on the 1 hour time frame which is the time frame that we're mainly looking at it we still haven't had that break and retest under so I am simply not interested at all there's nothing that we can do GBP JPY is what we're in right now we simply have to do one thing and that is set and forget so I'll see you guys tomorrow in the in the morning and let's see how we wake up with the account ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry to announce that we have reached the goal for the week actively right now we are currently up $330 you guys can see here so last night literally what I said happened once again so look check it out GBP JPY right after that 1 hour bearish engulfing candles STI literally the whole momentum throughout London session was that bearish move to the downside had my takeprofit set at a 1 to 3.4 Rich reward so meaning if I risked 100 bucks here then I would have made $340 right here as you guys can see that is literally the math that is happening right now now some of you guys may be asking yourselves why didn't the trade take me out at my takeprofit point where I have it well ladies and gentlemen that is the whole point of set and forget I don't ever actually put the tap take profit numbers so I never actually plug in this number because I want to maximize the risk to reward that I get on the trade I always put the stop- loss cuz I want to cut my I want to cut my losses short but I never want to cut my profit short so even though we obviously you know we're probably up like $600 $700 this trade then end up putting back a little bit um so right now we are at this point right here this trade is giving us a 1.38 risk to reward beautiful bearish move the trade played out perfectly daily time frame you have a beautiful bearish and golfing Candlestick everything playing out perfect so our goal for this week was to turn $100 into $200 we're actually up $400 so we just hit the target for this week and for next week so we have a whole week ahead which is pretty cool next um just to show you guys a market update on the other markets so this is GBP JPY gbpusd as you can see we were waiting for that break and retest under to then sell we did not get that break and retest under meaning we did not enter the cell this is the importance of patience no break and retest no entry loss avoided this is the importantance of having the trading plan and sticking to it Euro GBP you guys can see I never quite really made it into that zone so we simply never executed the trade and then GBP CAD same exact thing we were waiting for a break and retest under in order to sell we never got it we never executed the trade this is the importance of having a trading plan ladies and gentlemen it does not get more legit and more transparent than that right there just to put you guys a little into a perspective If This Were to be $11,000 we would be up $3,500 right now if this were to be $110,000 we would be up $335,000 and if this were to be a 100 Grand we would be up $350,000 nothing changes in the market only only thing that changes is how much money you have in the account and how much money you're risking this Candlestick is going to close in 15 minutes over here so I want to see how this Candlestick closes right here in 15 minutes and then based off of that I'll then make my decision and let's see if we can then this week flip this $450 to then $800 or $900 because that would put us really really really fast into the margin that we need to be in order for us to flip the $100 to the mail a lot faster so keep you up there so trade update right now it is currently 2:30 in the afternoon pretty much we closed at a $437 in profit you guys can see it here on the [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] look there's fans everywhere here in Miami I love you guys trust me I have so much love for the fans all like literally you guys know where I live it's [ __ ] crazy but we're here showing you guys the account you guys can see here the my effects book pretty much how it's looking currently up $437 these are pretty much the fees we got to pay these are the orders or there's nothing open right now this is the history though you guys can see here both positions that we ended up taking that's the profit that we Clos in and now same [ __ ] gym time no it sucks so you only get to drive one Supercar now Lamborghini twin turbo just sold it whyde body yours is at the shop the rear brake caliper is broken they're fixing it the Porsche I blew the second gear on the Porsche drifting uh rollsroyce is finally getting done wrapped should be done today or tomorrow what other C do I have the May back I'm not going to drive oh yeah oh I sold the Scat Pack got rid of the Scat Pack Scat Pack is gone that was probably the dumbest thing I ever bought yeah the side by side the side by side is in the shop as well bro half of my fleet right now is in the shop I only get to drive a Ferrari right now [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] all right guys market update it is currently Wednesday night 11:47 p.m. and you guys can clearly see the account is currently at $437 now you might be asking yourself am I going to keep trading am I going to stop trading H well my goal for for this week was to turn $100 into 200 and then next week 200 to 400 so technically I reached the goal for this week and for next week what would you do let me know in the comments below would you stop trading for the week and next week or would you look for other opportunities just for the lower risk that's what I'm thinking right now I don't want to stop trading because there's there's great opportunities in the market why should I just simply not take them I might just take them but obviously instead of risking the higher amount that I was supposed to I'm going to risk simply half that much because I'm on tracks I'm I'm literally ahead of the time that I have planned to pass 100 to the mil let me just show you guys a little bit of the market so this is the beauty of having a beautiful Trend continuation pattern this trade if I would have continued hold all the way to this point would have gave me a one to8 meaning I would have turned the $100 to $800 in one single move without doing anything I would have literally saved 3 weeks on one move but obviously I'm sticking to my plan so as of right now this this Market is actively having a pullback to what looks to be like this level of resistance right here but I'm not really that interested on GBP JPY anymore we got the money from it and we're pretty much gone the next Market is we have is gbpusd we've clearly had a break to the upside and as of right now I am not interested in anything on gbpusd other than this break and retest under Euro GBP this is the one that I'm liking right now because it is approaching this area of interest on this PR previous structure level so we finally have our well we haven't made it just yet we're getting there very soon so now I'm going to be waiting for either a bearish and golfing Candlestick from this level here so then we can sell and then GBP CAD we never had the break and retest under so what I do is I come over to this section right here now and I'm going to put Euro GBP as my number one pair that I'm going to be simply interested in which is a bearish engulfing Candlestick here something like this engulfing here this engulfing in here this and go in here so all we have to do is be patient my trade London session again today we're just going to lower our risk so that being said it's day three going way better than the last challenge to start off and all I got to say is set and forget all right guys good morning trade up there right now it is currently 9:21 in the morning uh pretty much nothing really happened last night let me show you guys it looks like it's happening right now so last night we were anticipating for this Candlestick right here to have a bearish engulfing Candlestick under this candle to then enter the trade we're pretty much looking for something like this right once it did engulf our stop loss would have been around here and then we would have sold luckily we wait for that entry signal you have to wait for the entry signal no entry signal no trade what do we do we avoided a loss so this right here is a prime example of patient paace but now it looks like we've actually perfectly tapped into this area of Interest here on the daily time frame you can see a daily Wick is currently creating and now if this 4our Candlestick closes under this Candlestick right here pretty much under here then I would be interested in then entering this trade this Candlestick will take about another 4 hours to close because this is a 4H hour Candlestick so we have to remain very patient GBP JPY literally did nothing you guys can see here that obviously throughout the night we just decided to have another little pullback we just pretty much slowed down uh gbpusd we did have a little bit more of a retracement but once again the only way I'll take this trade is if we do this and then GBP CAD just not even interested at all we could dish it for the week the only one we're interested in right now is Euro GBP so patience patience pays and this is exactly what experience gives you waiting for that entry signal waiting for it to hit the area of interest just avoided the loss I could have literally just blown the account if I wasn't a little of a paycheck so actively right now it is 9:32 in the morning the account is currently sitting at $437 Still Still exactly the same now let's wait see what the market [Music] do you're looking like a shorter version of Mike thirst mik my boy all right guys mark update it is currently Friday 1 in the morning so pretty much today no trading volume spent the majority of the day just home pretty much what I do every single day currently the market is still exactly the same I mean the account is still exactly the same let me show you guys the market though so earlier today we were waiting for price to have a bearish engulfing Candlestick under this line right here we did not have that so we did not take the trade uh daily time frame did not close with a daily rejection so there's nothing that we can do GBP py did start having a little bit of a pullback pretty much how we anticipated but I'm not interested in it gbpusd has officially broken under now we're going to wait for a little retest to then head to the upside we did have a little bit of a quick retest here but not quite what I would want I want to have something like this retest bearish candle and then enter so we're got to wait for this pullback this might be ready for next week and then GBP CAD just hasn't really done anything so let's see if we can get GBP USD to have that pullback tonight during London if not we'll take it in the last couple of hours of New York on Friday obviously not too close to Market close if not worst case pretty much done trading for the week I'll update you guys in the morning and see how it goes and just like that the week has come to an end this has been probably one of the best starts to the 100 to the m challenge that I could have probably ever asked for but before I do a recap let me just show you guys how the markets closed off so you guys can see here that Euro GBP we did not have the bearish engulfing candles stick at this point or at at this point so we never actually entered this trade at all and this is key and I'm showing you guys how you can avoid a loss being involved in the market is not how you make money in the market it's actually avoiding the unnecessary trades to be involved in the market so less is more in trading next is GBP JPY you can see our trade pretty much didn't pull back exactly where we wanted to to enter again but we already made the money that we had to on the trade that we took so we just set up forget that market gbpusd did not retest this level to then sell so we never took the trade and then GBP CAD never had the break and reach the under so then we never took the trade this is a prime example showing you guys how patience pays and it's going to be the key to making money in this Challenge and successfully flipping the challenge so you guys saw to give you guys a little bit of a recap how we traded this week and how I plan to continue to trade for the rest of this challenge at the beginning of the week we analyzed the markets on Sunday Swings with students and we picked out the top three top four pairs that we're going to trade for the week and the most aggressive one was going to be GBP JPY because it was a counter Trend trade because we're trading against the trend but you can almost predict that the market is going to have that pullback because of a reversal pattern shift of structure break of structure EMA candles rejection all these different types of confluences that give you more of a reason to enter the sell versus the buy with the market and the market almost needed that sell then after we took that trade we said and forget got about a 1 to four risk reward on the trade which is amazing cuz it actually set us above our takeprofit goal for for the week the goal for the week was 200 bucks we got it up to $437 which is literally double of what we predicted but then after that instead of calling it a week we pretty much looked for another trade opportunity to enter the market which is going to be Euro GBP which was hopefully take the account from 400 to 800 but we did not take the trade because we had to wait for that specific entry signal so we took a trade and then we avoided a loss later down that week because we remain patient and we follow the set and forget strategy if you want to know more about the set and forget strategy where it lets me find markets just like these click the link in the description below because that is exactly where I host cause every single Sunday with my students and I'm sharing the

I Turned $100 Into $3,074 in 14 Days Trading Forex
Jul 28, 2024

it's week two of me trying to turn $100 into a million day trp last week was week one let me tell you all about it so last week was the start of the 100 to the mill Challenge and the goal was to take $100 to $200 last week and we almost blew the account on our first position that we entered because the trade went straight into our stop loss the account is not looking that good right now you guys can see that we're currently down about $32 on the account but we ended up turning the $100 into $437 with one single trade so we outdid the goal for last week because the goal for this week was to take the $200 that we would have made last week to then $400 this week now this week since we're starting with $437 the goal is to take $437 to $900 by the end of this week because the goal of the challenge is to double up every single week so this week is 400 to 900 the next week is 9900 to 1,800 1,800 to 36 so on until we turn $100 to a million day trade so with that being said let the challenge begin good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to week number two training $100 into a million today it's late caught us late this morning it is Monday morning at 11: in the morning usually I would do this at 9:00 a.m. but honestly all morning I've just been looking at the charts potentially about enter your trade and we just opened the brand new Instagram account where I'm going to be doing daily updates on the trades that I'm going to be taking and this account is named 10 121m so if you guys want to go see updates on the type of Trades that I'm taking aside from YouTube here after it happens go follow that account with that being said we got I think seven solid markets in the markets seven solid markets in the markets it's a lot of markets a lot of [ __ ] money that's what I'm talking about but before I get started oh [ __ ] let me show you guys the my Facebook account like always and let me show you guys the metat trador just so you guys can see stting balance of the account so right now account is still on $437 and you guys can see here on the my effects book it is the exact same thing $437 188 as of right now 11:00 a.m. Monday morning no trades have been taken let me show you guys let's start off with USD JPY so USD JPY has a very clean left head kind of right shoulder action going around here we broke the neckline now we are retesting the neckline of The Head and Shoulders along with the 1H hour EMA 4H hour time frame looks absolutely phenomenal we're having a beautiful 1H hour bearish engulfing Candlestick looks like we're having that pullback to retest that previous structure level and then the daily time frame does not get any cleaner than this daily previous structure level daily EMA and then you guys can look left it is obviously a level of resistance whenever we're under a level resistance whatever we're under and this line right here what is it you may be asking around psychological level 1575 we or like the smart money concept guys would call it an order block potato potato this is a round pychological level within area of Interest so this trade is my number one trade that I'm going to be interested in taking this week all I'm really waiting for on this market so earlier this week what I was waiting for was this break so that break already happened and now this pullback is actively happening so I just got to wait for price to go back into this area so I can actually enter this trade I analyzed this yesterday with the students on Sunday swings but obviously it paid out a lot faster I was literally as I analyze the markets I'm like you know what I'm not going to start the YouTube series into tomorrow and then literally in the night time it played out so I might have to start these series on Sunday as soon as I get off the call with the students but with that being said the next Market is gbpusd so gbpusd was the market that we were actually looking to trade last week so last week you guys can tell that we were in this bullish market right here we had the break and then on this ret test right here we did not find an entry so price continued to head to the downside but then we officially had the retest as we've been looking for it for this level and then the daily time frame is where it actually starts looking clean because you can see the shift in the market so the daily time frame you can see how this is a beautiful higher low higher high we broke it now I'm waiting for price to come back and then retest that area of interest and that structure point so literally all I'm waiting for on this Market is for it to actually just pull up into this area so I can execute the trade cuz again this area of Interest also has a round psychological level 1. 29500 so this is a very key area where we should be selling I could sell right here but I would just have to have my stop loss really big and then that'll just make the risk to reward ratio not make any sense the risk reward ratio has to be a minimum of a 1 to2 so as of right now we got to be very patient as we wait for this trade to pull back to this area to enter the market next Market is going to be GB P CHF so a quick actual fun fact about GBP CHF it is probably my favorite pair and my most OG pair gbpchf is the market that made me the trader that I am today because I caught a really nice bull run back in 2021 as soon as you know Co was finishing and literally this was the pair that made me realize to trade with the trend and trade with Rift management RI RI Rift management Rift management the point is I haven't traded this Market since then because just hasn't been giving me great opportunities and I've been trying to enter a trade on it but I haven't been able to find one and I think this might be the one so as you guys can see right here daily time frame we are clearly having a rejection from this resistance resistance and then resistance level where now we could be holding it as support you go down to then the 4H hour time frame and the 4our time frame you can see this is a strong level of resistance through here resistance through here we're just waiting for a quick break retest so then we can head to the upside so this is an accumulation or uh consolidation an inverted Head and Shoulders whatever you want to call it it's price stopping at the strong level of support and resistance now the only way we can take it is once we have the confirmation of the break and retest it's going to be the break and retest of this neck line of The Head and Shoulders break and retest of that EMA break and retest of this area of interest and break and retest of this round psychological level 1.500 probably one of my favorite trades as well for this week so those are three very high high probability trade setups this next trade setup I already played out and that is GBP JPY so last week the first trade that we took on the 100 to the mail account was this one on GBP JPY where this trade turned the $100 into $437 and then on the next entry we're waiting for this retest to them sell which the retest didn't happen as the area that I wanted to we missed it by about 30 to 50 Pips and then the trade headed to the downside so this trade is pretty much gone the trade setup never really gave the entry and we just missed it but you can see here on the daily time frame that it is very clear the break and then the retest for the trade to go to the downside once again retesting round psychological level 24. but this trade was missed so we didn't take it last but not least on the trades that I'm interested for this week that could happen kind of fast it's going to be Euro GBP so eurogbp is actually a followup from last week's Challenge Series as well last week we were looking to enter the trade right around this area if we had this as a 4H hour bearish and golfing Candlestick which we did not so then this week I'm going to be waiting for this break and retest for price to then head to the downside something that I could also wait for is this little left head and then a potential right shoulder to play out right here then all we would do is wait for then the retest of the neckline of The Head and Shoulder so then we can take the trade to the downside so as of right now we have about four to five really really good Market Sal ons that I have are not that great not going to confuse you guys but all I am going to say is the one that I'm pretty much almost ready to enter is going to be USD JPY as soon as we pull up to this little area of Interest right here so as of right now it is currently 11:14 in the morning Monday morning so s and forget see where today takes us and if we end up entering this Market all right guys trade update it is currently 6:30 in the afternoon literally haven't done anything today haven't left the house weather is ass it is currently hurricane season in Miami so there's literally like a storm going down earlier and couldn't really do anything so just been home all day but the market is about to give us an entry on this trade so let me show you guys so this is USD JPY we're having the pull back exactly how I wanted to right to that area of Interest right to that EMA to then reject the neckline of The Head and Shoulders reject the area of interest and you have that 1 hour bearish and golfing Candlestick I love how the daily Candlestick close with a beautiful like look how beautiful that daily bearish Eng golfing Candlestick is and tomorrow we'll probably going to fill that Wick so this is a very very good trade setup where I'm be interested in taking this trade very soon I'd say within the next hour or two like obviously right now we're not in the trade just show you guys met a Trader we are still outside of the trade but this sh looks very very solid so this is just USD JPY which I might take tonight next is going to be gbpusd so gbpusd we are anticipating for Price get back into this area so that we can actually take the trade so we started doing that already started having the pool back into that area and we're on the way there pretty much just set and forgetting till price gets to this point GBP CHF we were ant anticipating for price to have a break and then a retest so right now we're having that break and the daily time frame has had that bullish Eng gulfy exactly how I anticipated and then euro gvp is currently having that daily bearish Candlestick we didn't have the engulfing how I wanted to but we did have this type of rejection from this area which is good I'm still waiting for this break and retest for us to enter the cell but GBP CHF is playing out perfectly USD JPY we're about to enter this and then GBP USD had the pull back to the area just waiting for a little bit more with pullback so we so so Market are doing exactly what we are anticipating it's been a very slow and boring day probably go hit the gym later um hopefully I can get one of my cars back today either my rollsroyce or my Urus I get it back today they're both in the shop and the Canon where's the Canon H dude that's right the Canam the boat's done though at least we got that the boat's good I don't forget yo yo oh [ __ ] with me huh [ __ ] with me literally usdjpy as simple and as effective as I look at this [ __ ] we literally had the retest perfectly to the area of Interest the Maru tweezer top rejection bearish engulfing Candlestick I keep telling you you need an engulfing Candlestick to enter a TH or a bullish engulfing to they by I'm laughing cuz the mic is moving so the point is that we're in this trade right now literally we already at $550 if this [ __ ] hits that takeprofit we'll probably be at like 2 3K it will probably even break the goal for the week that we've been anticipating so for now just going to so don't forget we literally full margin this trade I don't know how they allowed us to put 2.0 cuz I'm using a 1 to 500 leverage I was literally like I maxed out the average I got really really good spread GBP USD has still yet to make it to this pullback right here of this level to then so and GBP CHF has not had the break and retest for us to buy and Euro GBP has not had the break and retest USD JPY is pretty much the only trade so this trade can either literally make us or break us it is currently 8:00 p.m. Miami time so I think it's like about 2 hours or an hour and a half from the last time I updated you guys and S and forget now what we're going to go do is pick up Jordan so Jordan and obviously you know it's battling cancer and stuff and his legs get really really swollen and I

for real I appreciate it course trust me you're going to feel better the more you do it this this looks trade trade update oh [ __ ] trade oh [ __ ] where's the phone all right guys Market open and it's currently Tuesday Morning 8:26 in the morning and currently how we're looking on this trade is we are up about $840,000 $850,000 so this trade has actually played out very very very well you guys can check out it's funny because I'm surpassing to go every single week without doing any more effort this is going a lot better than the last challenge so you guys can see right here the entry that we had yesterday pretty much predicted the push last night where we were was kind of at this Candlestick pretty much having a pullback throughout all of London session this whole entire Market had the push to the downside when we were at this point right here we were probably up about $2,000 but obviously price has had a retracement to this area where it's actually my realistic takeprofit cuz I'm supposed to be risking one to get about two but I'm trying to stretch it out and get about a 3.4 so this Market is looking absolutely beautiful on the 4H hour having very strong bearish momentum and then the daily time frame is having very very strong bearish momentum I'm going to wait if this daily Candlestick closes under this line right here I can legit have this Market go all the way down to potentially areas like this over here so to retest this previous structure level if this daily Candlestick body closes under that line right there if it closes under then we can have the movement all the way to the downside so USD JPY just to show you guys once again currently moving very very very nicely into profit about $840 of profit which our goal for this week was to have a total Equity or balance of about $800 $900 so we are about to double that and it's looking very nice I'm not looking to enter potentially another position you guys can see right here gvp USD we've actually had the retracement somewhat to the area of Interest where we were looking to sell but price did not quite make it there so we couldn't enter the trade even if price did make it there I would have not entered the trade cuz I'm already in a winning one there's no reason why to add risk if you're already in a winning position but this shows you guys that the set and forget strategy and the market analysis is correct then you have gbpchf which is having the break and retest perfectly as we've been anticipating kind of sucks that I couldn't couldn't trade this because I already in USD JPY but once again just confirms that the strategy is working and then EUR GBP is literally doing exactly what we mentioned yesterday it's having the break it's going to then have the retest to then head to the downside this is literally as textbook as perfect as it gets we haven't missed so we're four for four five for five for this week every single trade that we've analyzed has played out which is [ __ ] crazy and all you really only need to do is catch one you don't need to catch all of them kind of impossible you catch all of them there's no need all you really need is one good one when you can up your wrist just a little bit and then you set and [ __ ] forget all right so curing up $837 can't make this [ __ ] up boys it's crazy we might actually hit the [ __ ] million dollars we we really might [ __ ] do it this time bro and you're surprised um bro cuz we're so ahead of schedule we should be by the end of this week at $400 dude we're like on week five already and it's week two Dam this is going a little quicker than a little it's going a little more s and forget than I thought so now I have to go to the dentist I'll probably take you guys with me take a little video have to go to the dentist after the dentist come straight back and update you guys again on what the Market's going to do so stay tuned set for [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so today we're taking oh my God M3 if you guys have ever been in a beamer you guys know this thing here gets all [ __ ] sticky trade update we're currently up about 1,00 so we're doing very very well today we get the Urus back so I have a wide body Urus pop it up yeah I haven't had the Urus for about a month because I landed to one of my friends and he broke the rear brake caliper so it was getting fixed so I get the Urus back today finally so I don't have to drive neither of these cars for a while and then Thursday so 2 days from now I should get the Phantom back and then the Porsche is in the [ __ ] shop fixing the clutch cuz I blew the [Music] transmission I personally don't think the transmission should have ever broken I don't think I did anything wrong look that's literally a cop right there right watch watch this the L when you're a profitable Trader the law just doesn't apply to you bro did you see that it was a cop yeah that guy just watched and kept on going with his day bro like when honestly if I was a cop and I hear somebody do that and I'm in a [ __ ] truck I'll be like have a good day bro like you're not going to get him yeah dude I'm I'm a menace sometimes in the streets with these [ __ ] cars and that was a really good drift too [Music] [Music] [Music] all all right guys so trade update we just left the gym right now trade update is currently 12:30 in the afternoon so like I mentioned earlier if that daily Candlestick closes under that previous structure level we're pretty much going to set and forget this [ __ ] for a very long time 4 hours looking good we are now currently up about $1,200 on the account so I'm going to continue to set them foret all right guys straight update it is currently 317 in the afternoon and we are up about 1,600 on the trade and you guys you guys can see here that the market is about to close you guys can see that the market is about to close in 2 hours so this daily Candlestick will close about an hour 42 minutes and it's honestly going a lot faster than I anticipated and we're definitely going to close under that previous structure level this is why you set and forget your take profit you never put a take profit you always put a stop loss to minimize your losses you never put a take profit you never want to minimize your losses so this trade we just continue to hold and so don't forget so as right now we just got the Urus back haven't had it for like a month and a half so actually what happened to it is that this rear brake caliper broke this rear brake caliper right here broke and all the oil from the oil lines leaked and you can see inside here how it's still like dirty full of oil you see how it got back here in this rear fender and it kind of like rusted all this or whatever because I just didn't want to fix it I broke it the oil started leaking and I got to the point where it stopped breaking cuz I ran out of brake fluid and that's that's where I'm like all right I got to go fix it now I was literally breaking hitting the break and it was not breaking there was no oil to it you see a light that does not look safe a we're fine we're fine always every single time you're going to H last than yours you have to do this course up so you hear the pops you think they can hear it there we go there we going to head little 20 roll let have a quick trade update right now at 100 m hour all right trade update is Curr we're currently up about 100 1,600 so we have to hit 160 mph all right ready I don't think we have enough space yeah we don't we don't have enough space Oh bro you want you want to know how stupid I am bro that I didn't even test if the brakes worked well they work all right well they work I'll tell you that right now we literally haven't been driving so stupid bro we haven't been driving this car because it hasn't had brakes and I literally had to stop driving it because I was getting to a stop sign and it just wasn't breaking I would have to put it in neutral from really far and then it would just stop and we just hit 130 not wi of ass breaks all right guys trade update right now it is currently 6:36 in the afternoon like you can see currently have about $1,600 on the account so we're up $22,000 the goal for this week was $900 and then the goal for next week was to turn the $900 to about ,800 so we're already ahead 2 weeks if I close this trade right now and truthfully I might let me show you guys right now the market so exactly how I anticipated the daily time frame has body closed under this this previous structure point right here so what I expect for price to do is for price to then now for tomorrow this Candlestick right here to have a pullback into this area to then head to the downside so we'll probably have a wick pull back like that and then the next day it will probably have then a push to the downside like this now I have to ask myself should I hold through all that should I set and forget or should I just close with where price is right now because we're already ahead of schedule but this trade without having to add any more risk I can literally add another, ,500 to the account with no extra risk cuz the next trade that I take I'm obviously exposing myself to risk here I'm obviously positive so this is what I'm predicting that the market is going to do so this is obviously the prediction so let me take this off and then let me take this off this is what it would look like on the 4 Hour the 4our would reest this line right here which is the line on the daily time frame that's just what it looks like on the for hours that's this line is a daily structure point so we can already remove this because this already happened to Perfection and what we would be waiting for is for price to have a pull back for here to then continue selling down I don't know I'm going to make up a decision probably in the next like 30 45 minutes uh to see what I end up doing but the other markets gbpusd gbpusd currently we have had the pullback not as far as we wanted to we did have a push and in the daily time frame we obviously had a push to the downside I would have just wish this came up a little bit further GBP CHF had a beautiful bullish reaction and then the next day we're having the retest we're having the retest currently of this resistance level being used as support So if I were to close USD JPY at this point where we are down here I would probably enter this trade right here because this is the one that's ready the fastest and then euro gvp is doing exactly as we wanted and it's having that break right now and then all we got to wait for now is this retest so we already had this this break now we just got to wait for this retest to then sell so everything is literally playing out to Perfection daily time frame has body closed under like if you guys go to literally last week's series you guys can see how we waited all of last week for price to pull back so last week price was down here and then we waited 1 2 3 4 days for the price to pull back and now 2 days of the reaction it'll pull back to themselves so go watch last week's series you guys can see that we've been watching this pair already for two weeks so for now currently up about $1,600 I'm going to make a decision very soon to either set him forget or just close it here and then we'll just add another [Music] position you know I'm not even mad about the [ __ ] tickets I don't give a [ __ ] I take them I have you know an assistant they take it to court I'm more pissed off that the park is closed so I just left the house to get a [ __ ] four this guy gave me four different tickets he gave me one ticket for not having my license on me dismissed one ticket for not having a license plate on the car dismissed one ticket for not having proof of insurance dismissed and then another one for running the stop sign dismissed sorry respectfully I love law enforcement I respect my law enforcement but none of that shit's going to [ __ ] none that's going to do anything uh you know what I think that's a little a bit of a payback revenge for the from what we did earli what we did earlier you know I rather have those four tickets all day than the charge of doing what we did earlier today trade update we're currently up we're up 1,900 so we're up actually $2,300 so what we're going to do now is go back home and I guess [ __ ] I don't know what to do right now it's 9 it's 9:24 in the afternoon we just fall asleep early and then just play basketball early in the morning but I think what we're going to do now is probably just go home [ __ ] I don't know what to do what do we do now [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] our definition of going to sleep early blood the on the Beamer yo I'm too nasty at this [ __ ] bro that is literally no handbrake no [ __ ] no break no nothing no nothing just car bro there is literally no angle kit no [ __ ] um clutch nothing oh [ __ ] the [ __ ] tire though damn oh my God straight up day so currently we are looking God damn wow bro wow how long did it take you last year to do this this is probably almost a month last year that shows you how much better of a Trader I've become I'm so much less attached to the profits and of the money behind this bro that's crazy dude dude that's like brand new bro it's not that bad piece of [ __ ] Chinese tires bro it's not that bad it's not that bad all right guys so I'm holding the camera sa I fell asleep it is currently 12:32 at night I think you guys can see it right there 12:32 at night and I just got out the shower and this is actually crazy the account is currently sitting at $3,000 [ __ ] dollar this is crazy you want know what's crazy I'm more excited about these $3,000 in profit than I am in like when I'm up 100 200k that's just like boring this right here is so exciting because you guys have literally seen this go from $100 to the point where it is right now let me show you guys what the market has done right here in the market you guys can see that the market has had the push to then the point where I said it was going to hit the next structure point for the takeprofit so bear with me I'm holding the camera so you guys can see this is the next takeprofit point that I said that it was going to go to we've hit that perfectly gbpusd has had the push to the downside then GBP CHF still kind of having the retest and then your GBP is having the pull back so we can enter another sell at this point right here to then sell we're just waiting on that so your GBP is the next trade that I'm interested in but USD JPY has been an absolute Beauty so I'm going to wait these next 30 minutes for this Candlestick to close you guys can see it has 30 minutes left before it closes um before I actually close this position on this Market but actively right now exactly how we are looking this is actively how we are looking right now we up about $3,000 this insane so this is transparency to its Finance you guys are seeing the before the during the after pre-market analysis absolutely everything this challenge is becoming a lot easier than I expected uh I'm more confident than ever I'm not attached to the money before I would have closed this position because I'm like oh [ __ ] I don't want to lose out on the profits for the week and just hit my profit for the week now I'm just looking at the charts and the charts are making the money because the trades are simply making sense so I'm just set of forgetting following the set of forget strategy and I don't know I'm lost for words I'm I'm excited it's about to be 1: in the morning and I'm just looking at the camera talking to myself and I don't know I'm kind of using this moment to like think back a little bit on the last Challenge and the person that I was then and I definitely was not ready to turn $100 into a m even though yes I was a millionaire and you know I was very successful and I knew exactly what I was doing I wasn't I wasn't prepared for it and I think that's why I blew the account but now come this time around I can definitely see the kid that I was back then and I believe that I am ready for it now and I think my actions are showing for it and it excit exites me because I'm seeing the growth not so much the money I can make a million dollars in a month not a big deal but it's more of the person who I've become to normalize turning $100 into a million with the skill set that I've Acquired and how hard I've worked for this skill set and the fact that it's literally paying off so so well like I'm even getting Goosebumps as I'm saying that because there was a point where 5 years ago I had nothing like none of this trading stuff did anything for me other than make me lose money fast forward now it has built me a ginormous Community like you guys watching this right now has brought me a crazy lifestyle gotten me a lot of freedom and it's probably because I never gave up so I just want to let you guys know if you're going through any rough moment or anything you know I've been through there we've all been through there and I can guarante [ __ ] tee you that it'll definitely be worth it at the end like I'm just sitting here in my office 1:00 in the morning by myself and it's moments like these where I really kind of connect to the reality of the situation of where my life is right now and it's all because I never gave up and because I believed in myself and I stuck to one thing so stick to one thing set and [ __ ] forget all right guys trade update or market update it is currently 9:00 in the morning Wednesday morning so as you guys can see we are current currently obviously closed the position you guys can see right here that the account is at officially $3,000 you guys can see here on my effects book pretty much uh where we started the account with the current balance updated two days ago you guys can see here the history these are all the trades that we have taken obviously two trades on GBP JPY one trade on USD JPY so last night I gave you guys a little bit of a uh I don't know I was like I was feeling good right because the challenge is going very well and really at night is when I get into de really deep into my thoughts and just look at this this is showing you guys that following the trend is key so we closed out the position yesterday right here at this point I could have legit continued to hold throughout this whole entire position and I would have probably made an extra, ,500 if I just continued to set and forget this trade would have given me a 1 to 10 risk to reward if I would have simply done nothing literally just set him forget why because I'm trading with the trend the trend is your friend and I'm trading what the [ __ ] hey SO trading with the trend along with the S forget strategy makes this so much easier but let's still another trade update on gbpusd so gbpusd we're waiting for the trade to retest this structure level here obviously we didn't make it we had to push down and it looks like now we're actually making our way up to that point this is why you have to be patient and wait for the trade to hit that area of Interest GBP CHF we never got our entry signal here on the retest if you notice we had the break then on the retest no bullish engulfing no trade loss avoided this is why it's so important to have a trading plan the set and forget trading plan avoided this loss for tens of thousands of traders in my Discord or even on my Instagram where I post these trades every single day and then lastly is going to be Euro GBP and in Euro GBP you guys can see how we literally had perfectly the break then perfectly the retest and then boom that engulfing Candlestick that I continuously keep talking about so this Market is actually playing out exactly how I've been anticipating I just obviously didn't enter a position because we're already in USD JPY and the goal for this week was take $400 to 900 we took $400 to 3K so we're definitely ahead of the ball now I'm going to debate whether I take more trades or not because honestly I don't need the extra risk uh pretty much done for the next I can L not trade for the next two three weeks and I'm still on schedule but if I do see a really good opportunity I can't pass it up because great opportunities in the market don't come every single week they can come every two three weeks so if the opportunity is there you got to make sure you capitalize off the trade that I would be interested in taking would be Euro GBP next if this gives me another little bit of a pull back to around here so I'm going to probably need a little pull back like this probably to this level so then head to the trade to the downside my entry here stop loss around here my take profit right around here only way I'll take gbpusd is if we have a pullback to this level to then sell here we didn't make it so we got to wait for it to make it basically what we're waiting for here is this so then so with that being said let's ah got actually almost sneeze yo so last night we drifting the Ferrari blew the tires we're drifting the M3 blew the tires today we have no more cars to drift but we got the ear back all right guys trade up there right now it's currently 7:00 Wednesday no new trade going to do some cardio call it a day honestly forgot hey 87 all right guys market update it is currently Thursday morning 9:23 in the morning yesterday after the basketball just came chilled uh I think I went out to eat it's pretty much it currently the account is sitting at exact same $3,000 we have not taking any new positions look how the market looks gbpusd never made it back to this area of interest and enter the cell so we missed out on that trade USD JPY we this loads had a big push to the downside now where it looks like we're having that retracement to the upside um this trade has still ginormous potential to the downside it has to have a really deep pullback before actually continuing to head down but I'm done with this trade for this week when I hit a big trade like this on a market I just cool done I don't focus it on it until next week um next is going to be GBP CHF so gbpchf we were interested in buying all the way up here and then the 4H hour really never gave us our entry confirmation right around here so we avoided this humongous loss that we would have taken now this is obviously giving us a left head and a right shoulder so now we could wait for the pull back into here to then sell to enter a sell on gbpchf and then last but not least is Euro GBP so we did have the head and shoulders we did have the break but then on this retest right here we never had an engulfing Candlestick so we did not take the trade that is the importance of having a trading plan and focusing and waiting on it you can wait for a trade for 2 weeks for it to do everything you wanted get to the area of Interest break the area of Interest retest it that can still take a week two weeks three weeks and if at the end you don't have your entry signal you don't take your [ __ ] trait that's exactly what we did here we've been waiting for this market for 2 weeks and it never gave us our entry signal we did not take the trade the first entry we missed it which is fine which is this one right here so we missed this first entry which is dis bearish engulfing which actually really good cuz we avoided the loss as a whole but on the next entry we never got the engulfing we don't take the tra we got set and forget merch that we actually got to go and ship right now bro I saw a package here from Poland Poland you know where Poland is in the map we got to sell one of the shirts to PO it's going just like this one time don't forget so appreciate you guys that buy the merch it's crazy I literally make I think it's like $2 for a shirt I literally charge you guys whatever I make it for cuz it's more for Branding don't really care to make money out shirts these are actually being sent out to you guys right now after we go do the wire so all right guys trade update it is currently 10:28 in the afternoon so today I haven't felt so good I ate earlier in the morning Oreo cereal for breakfast I haven't feel like ass all day don't eat Oreos for breakfast or Oreo cereal don't do it I feel like I haven't even left the house all day um wearing a hat my hair looks crazy I'm trying to let it grow I'm trying to look like Brad Pit when I like slick it back I think I'm getting tired of it I might take it all off I'm not that patient letting my hair gr I like looking fresh but tomorrow I getting a haircut early in the morning but with that being said straight update currently 10:29 at night the account is currently still exactly the same no trades in the account as of right now we're still at $3,000 so this is what gbpusd looks like gbpusd obviously the price didn't make it had to push to the downside then USD JPY kind of pretty much in the same spot as all day GBP CHF obviously avoided the loss it's down here and then Euro gvp just did not stop at I completely decided to go to the upside again no bearish engulfing no entry signal no trade so we're definitely up definitely up for the week so the goal is 900 for the week we're at 3,000 let's see if I can maybe squeeze a little trade tonight probably doubt it and um tomorrow we'll have a little quick recap of what the week was like and what we expect to do next week I might decide tomorrow if we continue to trade next week or if we just call it a week for about 2 weeks and then we just set and forget because we're about two weeks ahead of schedule so again make sure you guys tune in every single Sunday we're going to be dropping these series every single Sunday until I turn $100 into a million but I'll update you guys tomorrow in the morning all right all right guys so market update it's currently 10:21 in the morning Eric got here a little late you know I don't know why he got here a little late and [ __ ] so getting a haircut get a haircut every single Friday Eric pulls up to the house so soon as I'm done in about like 15 20 minutes I'll show you guys the charts on how this week ended

new trying out with my barber let me know in the comments below if you guys like the new hairstyle or not I think I like it I just feel like I look old as [ __ ] what do you who do you think that I look like the bad guy from Harry Potter yeah I don't know who the [ __ ] that is pop up a picture of him let me know if I look like him let me know in the comments below if you like the new hairstyle don't play like a clown music or nothing bro I think it looks dope right I think it's like a new like slick back kind of vibe obviously my hair's not long enough for it yet feel like it makes me look mature feel like I look like a young man you know maybe I can actually hit the 100 to the mail now cuz I look like a Wall Street dude look at me don't I look like a Wall Street guy well half even half course don't oh yeah you're right the point is I'm I'm that guy now you know what I'm saying all right so look it say pop up a picture of me here with bald head me right now and then me would like the hair to the side let me know which you would you guys like in the comments below with that being said let's do the recap of the week so before we do the recap we start off the week with $437 and our goal for the end of this week was to actually take it to $900 now obviously this week we have very clearly surpassed that and we are currently saying sitting at $3,074 on the account and this was all done by taking one single trade but now I'm going to show you all the markets that we analyzed at the beginning of the week how they played out which one's won which one's lost and obviously which one we ended up taking and actually before I show you guys the charts let me show you guys that we are in a real account indeed so you guys can see right there to the top left corner how it says real account and then you guys can see the account metrics and where we're currently sitting at which is a total of 3 $3,074 so now with that being said let me actually break down the exact markets that we traded this week so we started off the week with USD JPY which is the winning trade that has given us the $2,000 profit for this week very clearly analized at the beginning of this week this head and shoulders movement right here and then we were entering right at this retest got the engulfing setad of forget now this Market went on for a lot a lot longer because we are trading with the trend so as you guys can see here on the daily time frame clearly the daily time frame went from bullish to then bearish we're selling at a round psychological level 157500 we had a daily EMA retest of daily structure strong level of support and resistance look how many different things we had for this Market to go to the downside and this is what I keep repeating to you guys and my students every single week when we analyze these markets cuz I got on a car every single Sunday with my students and I break down these markets with them them where I share them my top two top three trade that I'm trading for the week if you actually want to be part of those calls with my students make sure you click the link in the description below cuz I'm sharing with them the trades that I'm taking on this account with them live before it happens every single week so make sure you guys click the link in the description below but I'm simply setting up a scenario where it makes more sense for this Market to sell rather than buy and the goal should only be to look for markets like these not look for any other markets so USD GPI we got it you guys can see very strong bearish movements and then next week we're probably going to be waiting for a retest here to then sell which should be a retest of this structure point and the structure point which are obviously in the same spot next is going to be gbpusd at the beginning of the week we wanted for price to have a pull back into this area to then sell price quite did not make it all the way up to that area as you guys can see we missed it by a couple Pips so we missed out on this trade but the analysis did play out so we have one winner which is USD JPY gbpusd which technically would have been winner but technically no trade GBP CHF which we're waiting for a break and a retest at this point to then head to the upside we did not take it one because we were already in the USD JPY cells and two because we never got the entry signal so a loss avoided we have one win which is USD JPY one win that we just missed and then one loss that we avoided now the next Market is going to be Euro GBP so Euro GBP we have the beautiful Head and Shoulder ERS and then on this comeback for the retest we never got our entry confirmation at this point so we avoided this loss completely so for this week out of the four pairs that we analyzed at the beginning of the week one of them was a winner the other one could have been a winner but we didn't enter it and then we avoided two other losses all you need to do is literally be right half of the bance of time and you're going to make money at the end of the week every single week using the set for Guess strategy and I think at the beginning of the week we also mentioned usdjpy for price to come back into this level to then sell but obviously that moved very very fast and we didn't end up catching this trade Dam that's [ __ ] crazy because this is actually the first trade that we took on the 100 to the mid account if I would have held all the way down here wow I think i' wouldd be at the milon already no I'm okay so that's pretty much the recap of the markets that we analyzed at the beginning of the week if you guys want to get these markets before they actually happen and you guys want to trade alongside with me you want to get these same exact markets that I'm trading on this 100 to the mail

I Tried to Flip $100 Into $6,000 in 21 Days Trading Forex
Aug 4, 2024

that doesn't seem good last week we turned $437 into $3,000 the account is currently sitting at $3,000 [ __ ] dollar now the goal was to turn 400 to800 but we actually ended up setting forget more than we should have on the trade and we got a really nice second entry in it we are currently obviously close position you guys can see right here that the account is at officially $3,000 you guys can see here on my effect book and the goal was $800 but it ended up playing better in our favorite we almost blew the account right at the beginning the account is not looking that good right now you guys can see that we are currently down about $32 on the accounts but ended up playing out in our favorite now this week's goal is to turn $3,000 into $6,000 so let's see how it goes all right guys it is Sunday evening so it is the first day of The Challenge on week number three first day with the new haircut on the new channel for the week first of all what is going on in here this the cat's yeah she's shy she's camera shy she had a party here last night and she [ __ ] went crazy but this is week three we're taking $100 to a maill we took last week $437 to $3,000 and now this week the go to take $33,000 to $6,000 ,000 just to show you guys like always it's currently Sunday evening 8:00 the account is currently sitting at $3,000 let me show you guys the market for this week because honestly I think it's as good as they were last week so you guys know every single week in the market is different some weeks have better opportunities than others but I do see great opportunity in this week so let me show you so the first one is going to be Euro USD you guys can see we have a very clear left head right shoulder and now we are retesting the neckline of The Head and Shoulders retesting the EMA and then we have a 4-Hour bearish engulfing Candlestick now if you guys saw last week's Series this exact same pattern would look extremely familiar from the trade that took us from $437 at $3,000 let me actually show you guys what time is it right now in Miami 7:37 in the afternoon refreshing the web page so this is last week's trade that made us about about $22,000 it's going to be this market right here so you guys can see USD JPY we got this left head right shoulder retested the neckline retested the EMA trade boom dropped one to was actually more a 1 to six to was around a 1 to six R to reward now for this one what does this market look like exactly the same Big Head and Shoulders retest to the neckline rejection from the EMA and then engulfing cesti so we're going to enter this trade as soon as we get a body cesti closure under this that is for Euro USD you guys can see it right here EUR USD next is going to be USD CHF so USD CHF on The Daily time frame we are clearly bearish heading to the downside now I'm simply waiting for price to have a pullback into around this area of Interest potentially round psychological level 8900 when you go down to the 4our I want it to come back in and then and retest this EMA level right here retest that EMA level it's going to confirm to reject this previous structure Point level right here and then we're going to be able to head to the downside very very very nice trade next is going to be GBP CAD so GBP CAD currently on the weekly time frame we've had very slow down one two weeks at a strong round psychological level 1775 and then the daily time frame you can see how from this bll run it was very strong right it was you know 2 days pause one strong push 2 days pause 3 four 5 days of very strong push but then it's been here for about two weeks in the same spot so it's literally showing signs of slowing down so this gives us an opportunity to enter a counter Trend trade now you can see right here on the 4H hour time frame we are literally lining up a left head and then a right shoulder to where this Market we can then have a break a retest to then sell to the down downside and then retest this neckline of the EMA we are literally lining up the same exact thing as EUR USD it is the same exact thing the only thing is that EUR USD is about two to 3 days ahead of it let me show you guys this is EUR USD right now currently in the 4 Hour very clear left head right shoulder break and then retest when you go to GBP CAD GBP CAD we are still missing the break and then the retest so your USD we already have this push and we already have this retest which is very clear to observe here the break and then the retest it's exactly we're waiting for on GBP CAD in order to enter this trade and then last but not least it's going to be the famous the degeneracy degener degeneracy degeneracy say it with me degener I can't even say [ __ ] degeneracy right of gbpjpy so GBP JPY we have a ginormous left head and then a potential right shoulder again key potential because it has not happened yet so I'm going to wait for this price to have a pullback into this level to then sell it'll retest this strong level of resistance how is done in the past to that sell and then we would retest the EMA which is then dip into it so then head to the downside now why do I say degener huh because we can have a counter Trend trade what does this mean this means that we are at a support level whenever we're here we reject above whenever we are under we reject to the downside well now we're Above So now this can have a push to the upside to create that right shoulder to then have the cell to the downside so we can be degenerates and catch this trade as a buy right here up into this point right here and then we can catch the cell once it creates that right shoulder from here back down in to this level now this is Ultimate degenerator right degenerator de D gen [ __ ] D gen [ __ ] you know so I don't recommend it but the opportunity is there so this would be our first dgen trade which would be counter Trend trade up into this area of interest to then sell and then the real trade would then be the sell once we're up at this level so yeah that's pretty much it honestly look like a fun week this week trading it is currently 8:00 p.m. that whole explanation took me 5 minutes does medit trator still have the money in it still has the money in it doesn't matter so tonight's what what should we do tonight Sunday I think we should just chill right I mean your definition of chill is very different I'm honestly scared of your definition of chill cuz your definition of chill is a chance of us doing nothing at the house or us stranding in the highway cuz something by the way let me let me actually show you guys this so this is for my students but I I give these away all the time so I have set forget pendants that I give away literally all the time like he's wearing one right now I have a couple so I have like literally a [ __ ] ton of these things that literally just sitting here I need a reason to give these away now L have [ __ ] they're all brand new I don't know all I have to say is subscribe then maybe you can wi have a shi of them just sitting here see you guys later all right guys so market update it is currently 9:43 in the morning it's your fault market update before I show you guys what just happened it is currently 9:43 in the morning as you guys can see the count is currently sadly still sitting exactly the same as $3,000 why well because I fell asleep last night can't even lie I missed the TR I fell asleep last night look at this [ __ ] right here bro so Euro USD you guys can see exactly how I mentioned left head right shoulder retest of the neckline I was waiting to enter as soon as we would have a break under this right here and boom the trade completely went straight to my takeprofit the fastest one to two about literally the whole entire challenge this could have easily taken our account from $3,000 to $6,000 like that but I was sleeping so look this is right now on the 4H hour if I would go down to then the 1 hour you can see how I have this line right here and my prediction was for price to break under it and then retest it to then sell price never retested it but you guys can see here at the time that that happened so this Candlestick right there follow this line all the way down here you can see how down here it's literally 3 in the morning so if we follow this line up you can see how it's that Candlestick right there July 29th 2024 3 in the morning 3 in the morning last night I was knocked out just to show you guys I'm a a man of uh my word this [ __ ] tracks it for me the [ __ ] whoop potato potato so you guys can see here last night I knocked out so I got 76% recovery last night I knocked out at 1:00 in the morning woke up 8:47 so I was like right in the middle of my sleep last night so wasn't able to catch this trade it is what it is next is going to be USD CHF USD CHF our prediction is for price to make it up into around this area so then we sell so we're actually actively pulling back to that area right now so this is actively going to probably be a trade very very soon we just have to wait for price to have our bearish engulfing so I'll probably enter this trade when we have have something like this so as soon as price has a little quick break and retest from this price right here I'll be interested in taking this trade next is GBP CAD so GBP CAD currently on the 4our we are looking like we're creating that left head and that right shoulder well we definitely are but I can't sell right into this support level CU if I were to sell right into this support level something like this would happen that then we have a reaction to the upside so the only way that I would I actually enter this trade is if break retest and then enter the cell in this market right now I am not interested in executing this trade at this High especially if the daily time frame is closing with a strong rejection Wick like this even though we still have 7 hours for this daily Candlestick to close you know I I can't enter this trade just yet I would have to wait for a strong daily body stick to close under the retest and then the sell next is going to be GBP JPY so we were interested in taking these counter Trend trades again fell asleep last night wasn't interested in taking it but it is looking quite interesting depending if today closes like this so once again if this daily Candlestick in about 7 hours closes like this as a dogee then for tonight in London session I will then be interested in executing this trade potentially when it would have some type of break and retest here to then head to the upside but for now not really interested I have to wait for this daily time frame to then close so I can actually determine what I'm going to do CU if it does close like this then it's going to give us the indication that it will come up into this level to then give us that left head and then the right shoulder so then we could catch those counter Trend trade buys and then usdcad currently we are at the high of the market and then I am going to be waiting for price to just break and R this under it's pretty much done nothing so the closest one to execution I would say is USD CHF and uh probably yeah USD CHF and probably GJ so obviously we missed Euro USD so the trade already played out I am literally no longer interested in nothing come us Euro USD the trade played out it happened it's gone so sucks that would have been a really good start to the week we would have probably already been at at the goal but that just shows you guys that the strategy is consistently giving you great opportunities in the market you just have to be ready to catch them I you know I wasn't up and honestly probably a year ago I'd be beating myself up for it and I would stay up all night tonight but now it's like bro I'm ahead uh I'm ahead of the challenge two weeks so I don't really care if I miss a trade it's not a big deal so this just confirms to me that the next year I'm going to take is going to be a very high probability trade because the set fre strategy once again is showing you guys the potential that it has to give you a high probability trade of going in One Direction versus that so right now it is currently 94 48 we're probably just going to wait on USD CHF which is the main pair probably hit the gym probably pick up Jordan oh by the way I saw you guys like Jordan in the last video bro my ass my ass feels cold as [ __ ] so we're going to bring him back we're going to talk tell him to talk more about his story and kind of how he plans to recover from everything he has he's set a crazy goal for himself and I want him to share that so you guys will see more of that throughout the video but just to pretty much summarize everything USD CHF and GJ we'll update you guys throughout the day all right guys so trade update we're about we're about to leave right now cuz they suspend my license notice of order of suspension of your license so yeah for those of you guys that ask I don't know how you have a license I don't all right I drift I [ __ ] race and it's just spend my license have to go to court now and get it back but I love it it's fun and then like now without a license we're going to go do men [ __ ] to go get our license back all right so this is right now currently USD CHF you can see it's the 1 hour time frame on USD CHF so we're just going to wait for this break and retest as of right now it just keeps pushing up to that area of Interest which is good it's exactly what we want we want price to hit that EMA and then reject and then retest USD CHF it just absolutely beautiful trade pretty much I cannot get any better than that gvp CAD still waiting for this and then GBP JPY we are going to wait for this later it is currently 10:32 in the morning so literally about an hour later from the last update let's go get our license back this line is for appointment only if you don't have an appointment please get on the other side do it do it do it oh I can't eat yeah I can't eat I'm on a I'm on a fast so right now I'm actually on a 30 probably like 32 hour fast tomorrow is going to be 48 then I'm done longest fast I've ever done usually I do it when I start getting too bloated trying to get shredded out here you know what I'm saying uh trade update is currently 10:00 at night me actually take you guys with have you guys seen my F1 car so I have a F1 Sim let me actually show you guys my F1 Sim so this is actually my F1 Sim so my goal was to actually wrap it like the color of one of my cars but it came red and I feel like it pops good on the wall because there's nothing red through about the whole house they have like the Harley Harley's Blue and then the set and forget sign is blue I don't think they've ever seen the Harley either no there's in the Harley this should even turn on got time for this [ __ ] trade update all right so trade update I actually update you guys on on the trade where it is right now so again it is currently 10:00 at night let me actually do it here on the computer is how I used to do before so I search up what time is it right now in Miami this is the last time that I actually refreshed it I refresh it now 9:59 p.m. so the markets Euro USD so let me show you guys the First Market it's going to be Euro USD so as you guys can see our trade from earlier would have played out absolutely beautiful trade gone so I and forget this is the next trade which I am going to stay up tonight to then enter usdchf having the pull back to the area of Interest exactly how I wanted to the 4H hour time frame very slow down at this area which is exactly what we wanted to see and then the 30 minute time frame we are going to be waiting for a little quick break retest of this area to then go to the downside GBP CAD is literally doing nothing what we wanted to do so currently we are at the high still we are rejecting and in the 4-Hour time frame we want for price to obviously break and retest under to then sell it's not doing what we want to not really that interested GJ is having the stop at this area exactly how we want to daily time frame has given us a daily bullish pinbar which is what we want to then take the counter Trend trade by so if I go down to the end the 1 hour we can see that the 1 hour is kind of accumulating at this area the only way I would actually enter this trade is if it were to give me a bullish engulfing Candlestick on this 30 minute time frame so if I have a Candlestick like this I'll probably enter right after that Candlestick stop loss right around here that'll give me about a 1 to 2 to 7 rist to reward so 1 to 2 to 7 should be very very solid and it'll be the perfect counter Trend trick so we're waiting on that so what I like to do is I put an alarm above this area right here so I just set an alarm right around here so if price does break above that I will be notified and then lastly USD CAD which we are at the high waiting for the break and bries under honestly I'm not even interested in this trade just has so much more so yeah basically sum it up GJ we can probably enter tonight on the 30 minute time frame once we have that break and retest from this level and then USD CHF break and re the under just to show you guys currently the account is still sitting at $3,774 just set and for game so let's see what time London we end up entering the trade tonight a bro I feel like [ __ ] [ __ ] I got to eat we should make it more interesting when you win a trade you should eat no no no no no no people want to see the trades I get big no hell no got me [ __ ] I'm going to look like you you all right guys straight update we had a little inconvenience one of our doors got locked last night we're trying to unlock it with this for those you guys that don't know I am not the best handyman so this was pretty much useless currently we have a very interesting morning right now it is currently 9:24 in the morning as you guys can see here 9:24 in the morning on Tuesday Morning 9:24 so last night once again fell asleep sorry [ __ ] fa again dude now you want to know what this whole fast [ __ ] literally like ass but I dropped 8 lb in 2 days not eating so I show you how much water we'd have I was at 194 and now I'm at 18 like 6 185 market update So currently right now on USD CHF literally exactly how I've been explaining yo yo yo yo yo I I got to I got to [ __ ] put me on Wall Street cuz put me on Wall Street bro cuz this is [ __ ] getting crazy I'm predicting every single one of these [ __ ] moves look at this yes yesterday we had the pull back exactly to the area of Interest exactly how I wanted and then I literally told you guys on the 30 minute time frame we were at this point right here I'm like all right we got to wait for this quick break and retest structure to them sell cuz that was the last higher low structure level then as we continue to create new higher highs and higher lows then this higher low structure level pretty much becomes irrelevant the next breaking retest structure we want to get is from this point right here literally just following the structure and we have the market like this this is literally the last higher low structure point so we have to wait for a break and retest here but if the market does this well then this becomes a new higher low so then we this becomes irrelevant and we have to wait for a break and retest structure Level under here I hope this makes sense I'm I'm pretty much like teaching you guys live right now right this is what I do every single Sunday with my students when I teach them the strategy but coming back into here if I just pretty much remove the replay you guys can clearly see that then this became the the new higher low this box right here is now irrelevant so now this is the new higher low where we have to wait for the break and retest and that is exactly what we have done we have had a beautiful rejection from the area of Interest exactly how I explained then we had the retest and now we have the engulfing so I'm looking to enter this trade probably in the next 2 minutes and 38 seconds as soon as this candle to closes because we have a beautiful left head right shoulder retest the engulfing I'll have my entry right on here stop loss right around here where I should have entered this trade is up here and I should be up about 11 Pips in profit but it is what it is you guys hear the Discord those are the students is going crazy right now like they're [Applause] [ __ ] so basically I'm looking to enter this trade in the next minutes and 58 seconds so we're going to come back to it in just a second so this is where I'm looking to enter this trade if it keeps going down look at this if it keeps going down that's where I just placed it like a minute to go so if it keeps going down I have to wait for a little we pullback whatever next GBP JPY so go watch yesterday's literally watch like go back like 15 [ __ ] seconds look at this GBP JPY yesterday I told you guys if this Body candles s closed above this one I would then buy so I had my thing there boom look at that I would have quickly caught in a easy one to 1.4 on this trade so I predicted the direction of this Market to Perfection literally exactly how I explained the last night because we had this break of the Candlestick stay here with the charts so we had this break of the Candlestick and obviously if you guys see the time of when that happened that happened around 1: in the morning down here you guys can see it was literally as soon as the market was entering London session I fell asleep so this is exactly what happened this morning price started having pullback now a lot of you guys are going to be asking me why didn't you enter now here again well because there's no confirmation to enter here there's a confirmation to enter at that point but now this is having a very strong pullback and I'm not that interested in entering the trade even though if I were to have been in this trade from this point right here I would be obviously set and forgetting but I don't want to now enter a trade without a confirmation so this would have been the trade that I took I can't retake this trade right here with no confirmation so basically I'm saving myself from a potential loss on GBP JPY but I am still very interested in entering a trade here if we have a rejection from this point so we have a rejection like this dogee right here and then we have a bullish engulfing like this one if we have literally these same three candlesticks but right here I will enter this trade 100% so USD CHF closing in about in the next 30 seconds oh no it closed oh [ __ ] all right so we're going to enter this trade in the next five minutes so you never want to enter a trade as as soon as it closes because usually like the first minute or two it's creating the wick to the upside so it's creating that Wick that Wick that Wick that Wick and that's where you can get a better entry so if you just see right now price is having that pullback and I believe it can easily have a pullback to about I think have a pullback to around like this structure point right here so it's literally on its way there already I've saved probably about two three Pips which is spread but we're going to literally enter this trade right now just to show you guys it is currently 9:30 in the morning we don't have any trads right now on the account let me show you guys the my effects book my effect book so you guys can see that my effect book currently exactly the same no trades right now and then this is the history of all the trades we've taken on the account so I don't forget all right guys so market update it is currently 9:49 in the morning we are officially in the trade so I literally enter let me before that let me show you guys the time right so what time is it right now in Miami I come over here I refresh the website 9:49 in the morning so literally to show you guys we just entered the trade so look pull up here so you guys remember how I literally just mentioned that we were going to have a pull back into this level to then sell so we literally had that pull back perfectly I went exactly to where I I didn't go exactly to where I anticipated but got really close I entered it and just to show you guys proof I was just recording for Instagram right now as soon as we entered the trade we're literally like using margin and [ __ ] because we entered the trade pretty much risked everything so I just wanted to show you guys that but now we're officially in the trade we are up $400 on it currently right now like always have to show you guys that it is a real account so you guys can see right here that it is indeed a real account you guys can see where the account is currently sitting and we're currently now going to just wait but I explained to you guys perfectly this I explained to you guys the break and retest here I entered at this next retest where we should have waited for it here should have waited for the break and retest here to then sell s but then this didn't happen here but it did happen here we then entered after the engulfing which ideally we should be entering up here but we didn't get that and then GBP JPY currently it literally stopped right at that area where we would have entered yesterday and I would have loved to be in this because I like this better cuz it's a degenerate trade it's the counter Trend trade and I do believe on The Daily time frame this is going to have the overall push to the this level if you notice the daily Wick has pretty much made it about 60% of the weight so we're almost there but USD CHF just looks more of a a less degenerate type of trade if this daily time frame closes anything like this or even it's daily time frame closes above this right here I'm just going to say this right now if the daily time frame closes above that line right there we're we're good we're good we're going to turn into about like $7,000 by this week 4H hour looks very good as well 4our time frame looks very solid believe it or not I don't love that engulfing Candlestick I don't love it because it's aabu so it does have the opportunity to come back and create that Wick but I do love this 1 hour Head and Shoulders pattern and this 1 hour very strong bearish Candlestick so this candle closes in about 7 minutes so let's see how it closes then so set that doesn't seem good thought you said you were a wizard it's all your fault yo we might blow this [ __ ] right now bro no no no no and you know what's funny I was so hyped bro I woke up like I was this [ __ ] man I I what did I say ear like 10 minutes ago um put me on Wall Street was stre heard you all right so in normal people terms what's going on so basically obviously I'm risking 100% of the account to then flip very fast so it looks like the trade is having a pullback to then retest that structure point I mean it's literally exactly what I said earlier earlier I said it's going to have that pullback to create that wick on top of that Candlestick but if it does go that far we'll probably have a mark Mar c and then the trade would probably close there's no other way of getting any more transparent with this I am literally showing you guys the should we just lie to people bro what if we just never make it happen and then we deposit another three and then we buy yes so then we're not wrong or should we wait cuz it could go back into profit wa we [ __ ] hold boys we we set and forget we're going to huddle so yeah basically right now currently we are 1300 and loss so we'll update you guys in 15 minutes yo how's the trade going TR update what are you doing this is this is going to make sense don't worry about this Che up is looking all right you guys can see currently we are now rejecting this point right here it's like I said it's going to come back reject that EMA and then potentially obviously reject down you guys can see right here on the account that we are currently pretty much at break even 1 hour time frame looks pretty good see we're literally about 100 bucks 1 hour time from looks pretty good and then we're just waiting now on this 4H hour Candlestick to close if it closes like look so what I meant by that is that that Candlestick did not have a wick to the upside so what I said is that price is going to have to pull all the way back up create that Wick to then head to the downside that is exactly what the [ __ ] it did it went up created that Wick and now it's actually having the rejection so you know we're still not fully in the green you know we're still around a little bit of draw down but definitely in a much better position that we were in earlier so currently right now market update it is 11 no 12:15 in the afternoon so about 2 hours later from the last update we probably won't see much movement now cuz you know Market slows down now towards the ending of the day so we're probably going to go ahead to gym I'm going to eat right now for the first time in 2 days 48 hour fast I am not doing this again my head hurts I feel like ass so we'll probably eat an after after I eat probably going to go see the Rolls-Royce I haven't seen it in a while it's still broken and um let's just see where the day takes us so I just want to show you guys how legit and how transparent this is we are up right now $2,400 oh man and all we did was literally set and forget so the trade came back into here I explained that it was going to hold and then we push the trade down so I just woke up from a nap I go to my phone and I look at my phone and it's literally blowing going up by dude I think it's easily over 10,000 people every single day just catching this USD CHF trailer you can literally see everybody here making money cuz I'm posting this on my story look this guy was up a couple hundred bucks this guy is up $4,000 bro look at this look at this you cannot make this up I'm literally showing you guys how transparent and how legit I do it every single day and it's not just me catching it it's literally tens of thousands of people catching it every single day all right guys so I'm holding the camera right now SE have to go to a doctor's appointment or something so literally I'm just laughing because I am so transparent and so legit I'm going to show you in a second how many people actually entered this trade so I just recorded that before I'm about to show you what I'm going to show you guys right now boys we are up currently $22,000 on the trade it is $142 in the afternoon as you can see in that top right corner all we have done is [ __ ] set and forget literally this is all we have done [ __ ] set and forget you guys probably can't see that [ __ ] but the point is we just set and forget let me show you so earlier we were up here in draw down and then we were simply set and forgetting and now the price has haded the push to the downside the wick I have explained it perfectly everything has happened to the tea exactly how I have explained beautiful full massive 4H hour bearish Eng golfing Candlestick what we are waiting for right now is to see if this daily Candlestick in 3 hours is going to close under this line or not so we have to wait for that to happen in order for us to be determining if we're going to continue to hold this trade because we're literally at the profit for the week so the profit for the week is literally $6,000 and we're currently up right almost at that point so for now Now set and forget we broke a little sweat earlier but we managed to hold GBP JPY we did not enter this trade one because USD CHF looked a lot cleaner and honestly if I would have entered this trade if USD CHF did not look as clean as this I would have taken this rather than USD CHF and I would have probably blown the account so I avoided a loss to Perfection on GBP JPY so for now USD CHF just set and forget and if at this point in the video you are not subscribed to the channel hit that [ __ ] subscribe button we're dropping a video like this every single week until I turn $100 into a million subscribe put the notification Bell cuz you do not want to miss this [ __ ] look my phone's raring up people want to catch these traits all right so I know this shit's loud but so we got Sensei a gift for his birthday funny enough me and Sensei actually have the same birthday I bought this right for his birthday and I've had it for like 2 weeks and I haven't even gave it to him so we're going to go drop it off now lives like 2 hous down for me and then we're going to go hit the gym we are currently let it load $2,200 in profit it's pretty much how much we're up so let's go drop off this gift hit the gym and then probably see Jordan later hello hey sir did just hey for you open be the story behind this Fu up the gift there's a story behind this gift it's going to make a lot of sense once you open it I if you know you know only if you know you know yes sir but so this is a very special edition watch so this is a Muhammad Ali M Blanc watch so you see it has like Ali through here and then you see the Muhammad Ali everywhere throughout here the mham Ali everywhere they only did seven out of 15 in the whole world for the non pen lovers out there how much was that pen the not pen lovers out there that was a Mont Blanc Mont Blanc pens average of like 500 to like two grand more or less but when it's a special edition Muhammad Ali uh 15 in the world only one drop the prices tends to be a bit more than that so how much was it let's just say it's just Rich [ __ ] [ __ ] you know Rich [ __ ] [ __ ] would understand I have two month Blan pens and you want to know what's funny I've never used them in my life it's more of like a if you know you know but honestly since I've never used it you really never know all right so this is how you drift the Ferrari right so look right now it's in race mode you got to put it over here turn off the track blow it look back make sure no cop if there's a cop it doesn't matter [Music] [ __ ] let me see the let me see the wash cuz if it doesn't have diamonds I don't I Chester legs clip a coin you want heads or tails um heads for chest tails for legs it's going to land on Tails hey Siri flip a coin tail Tails Tails I told you [ __ ] all right I'm ready [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right you either do this or you're blowing that count it's lightwe [Music] that was heavy as [ __ ] I can't even lie that's just light work that's light work right you don't work out like me bro yeah I your him your himothy of course all right look at my size compared to you what are you going to say when I do this that's that's just me warming up what you doing right [Music] [Music] 7 [Music] did we hit the go yet you have to make an appointment to talk to me son by the way I don't drink water from this I just ran out of a container to mix my electrolytes and [ __ ] like [ __ ] dude we almost blew the account earlier and now we have surpassed the goal for the week if you guys look at this on the daily time frame you guys can see how we body closed under that line exact how I had explained so this [ __ ] can easily easily easily come down here which that would pretty much put us in a position of about $6 to $7,000 in profit of this so once again I've surpassed the goal for the week in the first trade look at my Instagram bro my Instagram is blowing up 100,000 people looking at my stories every single day I'm I come over here and then we can see look at this look how many these are all like new people look at this guy eating some [ __ ] potato or whatever corn look at this all these people are catching the traes sup my guy this guy did the light skin face bro this guy up $1,000 on the USD JPY trades that we caught and the USD CHF I don't care what anyone has to say FX at she does the best go check out that guy's Instagram my boy Mike turning [Laughter] $100 bro it's all day like I get hundreds of you guys every single day so we fasted made people money we made money uh hit the gym play basketball what is there to do bro what else do we do K Godfather theme song I'm himothy the point is that we are up $8,000 on the challenge right now by simply set and forgetting the goal for the week was $6,000 we are now $22,000 above that you guys can see right here on both phones both exactly the same and then you guys can clearly see right here on the charts exactly what I was explaining earlier so we originally wanted to enter at the break and retest of this and we did not then we did enter up here but this shows you guys how these zones that I spot out every single Sunday with my students are so accurate because we did end up break and retesting this point to then continue heading to the downside we could have literally added a position right at this point here to continue the sells to the downside obviously we're not going to do that cuz it's a highrisk trade but we're literally halfway to our takeprofit and we already way above the profit Target that we wanted to go but I do believe this could easily head all the way to down here very soon so all I plan to do right now is simply set and forget the daily time frame looks absolutely beautiful 4H hour time for because it closed under that line exactly how I explained we came back we retested that line 4H hour is looking absolutely solid it's perfect GJ on the other hand completely wrong avoided this loss to Perfection Euro USD obviously we have the big head and shoulders the move happened that's gone and then GBP CAD right now we are literally still waiting on this break and retest to then sell so for now all we have to do is just let usdchf right set and forget it is currently it is currently what time is it 811 p.m. Tuesday afternoon so if we close I got around $8 $9,000 in profit probably this same week I'll try and flip it to then 20,000 this same week moving quick boys moving quick all right what is up guys trade out there right now it's about 1:25 in the morning 1:30 in the morning um technically Wednesday yeah Wednesday night Wednesday morning potato potato I'm tired of [ __ ] but I don't get tired of looking at these [ __ ] profits so check this out so Seas is knocked out so I'm kind of holding the camera right now and this is just showing you guys the power of set and forget you know what's funny I saw 10,000 in profit in the p&l so let me show you guys all right so bear with me guys I'm working this big ass camera and I don't know how to use it so right now we are currently floating about $6,000 in profit the account is currently at $99,000 in equity and you guys can see this trade right here is literally continuing the momentum to the downside just continuing the set and forget Trend that's why you got to trade with the trend the trend is your friend so you guys can see the for close very strong I am going to just continue to hold this trade uh if tomorrow closes under this line right here not this one I'm just copy and pasting if the Candlestick closes under this line right there we will probably turn this into over $115,000 easily so let wait for now simply just set and forget so GBP JPY ass Euro USD ass GBP CAD ass only focusing on one pair right now so yeah we're to check back in tomorrow just to show you guys once again what time is it right now 1127 in the morning Miami time [Music] [ __ ] with the sudden forget strategy [ __ ] I literally went to sleep last night like at 2:30 in the morning and I saw like about I don't know like in the account like $7,000 in profit like you know what it's just s and forget I woke up at 8:30 I literally did this oh and I just ran straight here right now market update 9:00 in the morning we are up $14,000 on the account bro this is [ __ ] crazy look at this [ __ ] literally exactly what I explained last night if price ended up closing under this line we're simply going to continue to set and forget if you notice my overall take profit hits exactly where we've been anticipating 4H hour absolutely beautiful all of these structure points have been used as break and retest points to then continue the sells to the downside this trade has been absolutely phenomenal look at this this trade can easily I'm talking about easily make it to this line right here which is going to be this next structure point right here so currently right now this is [ __ ] $114,000 bro $100 to $14,000 in 3 weeks or two weeks and a half if you have not subscribed and you haven't joined the S forget community link below you're missing out by the way this is real [ __ ] she was 5 grand this [ __ ] [Music] goldplated it's empty suck about to shot something through the roof yeah this is real so I'm feeling like that guy today you know what I'm saying I got that thing on me I got that thing on me I don't know bro I'm hyped that's it so basically what I'm going to do is right now we're going to literally close in the next 15 probably 30 minutes um cuz right now let's see that we body Clos under this is exactly what so we did not body close under that right there which is not good we wanted a body Clos under that line cuz if it did then we'll literally make it to them this line that's just how it works I just know I'm just I'm just that I'm himothy I'm just that guy you know so since we did not close into that now we're going to have a rejection exactly how we've done here reject to the upsite so we got to get out before we before we miss out on all the profits so GBP JPY uh currently this trade was just a complete violation Euro USD looks like it's pulling back GBP CAD look yeah this is prob yeah this is probably going to be our next trade yeah this can be the next trade that can then take us to like 30 40,000 just waiting on this trade to then do this to then enter the sell to the downside yeah that's pretty much it sat up for ladies and gentlemen today we're probably going to go hit the gym and uh see what other missions kind of pop up throughout the day so once again just to show you guys where we are up the $4,000 oh wait this one's updated give it a second you see it oh there you go updated all right market update is literally 30 minutes later we are still in the trade so now we're up 15,500 so exactly what I was mentioning to you guys earlier I have to see like you can't just close a trade right away right because you got to look so obviously we're going to close a trade because we wanted it to close under this line well under this right here and actively looks like we are piercing through that so this Candlestick closes in the next 5 minutes as you can see right over here and if this Candlestick closes under this line it will mean that it closes under this structure point and then there I truly do believe that it could then easily go from here to then this point right here so right now we literally got to wait the next 5 minutes if it closes above like that I'm going to close it right then and there if not I'll squeeze it in for the little bit extra right here just to show you guys we're up about 15,100 right now [ __ ] bro Trace set are reversing on me dude look at this Bro [ __ ] Trace set reversing we were up like 15,000 here and now like I said I forget too much bro it's like we closed the trade like 2 hours ago so right now it's currently 12:30 in the afternoon right here you guys can see where the account is it's officially closed at $115,000 you guys can see right here in the history so you guys can see that we officially closed this trade at $122,200 in profit so we we closed it earlier literally as soon as I told you guys pretty much after it closed that line so it did make it all the way up to this structure point and then it had a reaction so pretty much exactly what I explained it's going to have a reaction from that structure point right here and if we follow this line it's exactly what it did so our entry points are as precise as they get our stop losses our take profit everything with the seven fre strategy [ __ ] sniper yo the goal for the week was 6 grand we are at5 ,000 so if we were to close at 6 grand this week the goal for next week was to turn 6 to 12 so we just did this week and next week's goal oh [ __ ] we should go on a vacation right ahead of schedule we should just [ __ ] off for two weeks right yeah I think we shouldn't we should stop doing content for two weeks since we're caught up that's what I'm saying and we should just stop cuz you're not subscribed to the channel right now so you don't want to watch this series so hit the Subscribe button and you know what I feel like I feel like when I'm into the trades for so long I just become numb to it and I obviously like I've done like a thousand Instagram stories already about it so I'm kind of like numb to what we just did right now like $155,000 is insane what we're going to do now is see if we can turn this5 to $30,000 this week because there's great opportunities if there's great opportunities there's no reason for me to stop trading all I have to do is just wait for those great opportunities so trade up there on the other markets so GBP JPY no entry no trade here here your USD pullback no trade no entry GBP cat so this is our next victim right here left head right shoulder so we are finally having this break that we have been anticipating now all we got to wait for is that retest and then we will enter this trade as a sell to then the downside so GBP CAD is looking very interesting the daily time frame is finally having that bearish break we need the retest to then sell so it looks very very very solid now pretty much it is currently 1235 in the afternoon we're going to go do a set forget commercial right now we're going to go do some donuts in the Ferrari dropping a one time merch real quick so yeah just do some donuts proba eat gym and let's see where the day takes us really excited to see how your energy is going to be when we reach 300K I think my energy is going to be a lot better I think it's going to be a lot better so we just closed out the trade 15,00 $ in profit so we're doing a commercial right now for set and forget merch these are like basic very basic t-shirts t-shirts do like one time drops they sell out and then we never sell them again cuz look this gray matches perfectly with the Gage it's almost as identical color that you're going to get so you know we got the GoPro ready and we're just going to hit some donuts for a little ad that we're going to do for s [Music] oh [Music] [Music] all right so it's been like 2 and 1/2 months just woke over man na I fell asleep outside tanning my Phantom is fat bro I've had this car for 2 and 1/2 months half of its life has been on a tow truck like with these cars it's a hit or miss you get a really really really good good one or you get one like mine that just [ __ ] [ __ ] up and I'm paying $6,000 a month for this and I've driven it three times in two months [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys trade update So currently it is 11:51 p.m. so right now we are literally exactly at the same spot $15,000 in profit we have not taken another trade so it's a little late it's about to be midnight but you know got to pull up to Jordan's house he just bought a cold plunge so we're going to pretty much set it up for him he can't set it up himself right now and we're going to just let Jordan show a little bit of his story and how he plans to recover and yeah tomorrow we didn't hit the gym today either so tomorrow we're going to work double make up for that so let's go help Jordan get this cop PL set up so it's going to help him with the inflammation so let's do it [Music] [Music] let's go this is it yeah it looks way smaller here I mean the reviews look decent but I guess this just like pops up yeah I think it's like one of these popping up ones yeah we're going to set up this cold plunge going to help Jordan's inflammation with his legs tell you guys a little bit about his story and what he's going through how he plans to get better story is really motivated so show you guys to not make any [ __ ] excuses all right what's going on everyone so in Alex's last YouTube video I was going through the comments and a lot of people wanted to know my story and we're curious as to like what happened to me and why I was in a wheelchair so I'm real quick I'm going just break it down to you guys and give you guys like a little summary of like my story so pretty much like two years two and a half years ago I got um diagnosed with cancer and I had to do like chemo uh radiation therapy like the whole nine yards and then I was good for sometime I was good for like eight months I was able to like focus on my trading I thanks to Alex and his mentorship like I literally was able to take my trading to the next level and then after that when I took my trading to the next Next Level I got hit with like the cancer again I had to literally focus on that again so pretty much I had to do chemo radiation therapy all over again so pretty much two full cycles of that and then after that thank God thank Alex we got back on track on our trading we were killing it and then we got hit with the cancer again so now we're literally dealing with that again now but what's different from the approach I'm going to take now as to the approach that we took last time is that now I'm going to take like a more holistic route and I'm going to go to like a a different doctor cuz here in the US the doctor and everything is like a little bit like shady so outside the US I'm going to see if I could find like something that's going to help me a little bit better now I remember when I was trying to become like a profitable Trader I used to see like certain things that would affect me and my outside circumstances and I used to be like crap like why am I going through this or like I used to like let it get me down right but the point is it doesn't matter what you're going through like you could use me as an example if I don't let this get me down you shouldn't let anything let you down for example if you're going through like a tough money situation which is like very common and trust me I've been broke as well too like I know what it's like to be completely broke I'm telling you like it's not permanent like you're going to once you get out of the situation you're going to be grateful to be in that situation if that makes sense so like for you to appreciate going fast you got to know what it's like to go slow if you're going through a tough spot right now just know that it's not your permanent situation and it's your mindset about the situation that matters now it's pretty crazy right cuz like I've been trading for 6 years so I spent like 6 years working toward a specific goal and like once you reach that goal it's crazy cuz like you hit the goal but you get something else taken away so like going through this whole perspective has a affected me in the sense of like I've reached like some very personal goals that I wanted to reach but I don't have like the things that I used to once value at a certain time when I didn't have those goals met so it's it's a literally like a crazy balance in life that just makes you realize that like it makes you realize that the materialistic things and everything that we Chase is obviously nice but you have to be in check and your health has to be on point because without that like there's literally nothing so it's pretty crazy I would say this is affected me in the sense of like um just being more grateful for everything and honestly like like just appreciate everything more and when I'm out of this situation like I'm definitely going to enjoy just living my normal life again like a normal routine driving my car yeah I would say it's whole situations just made me realize like that the small things that we take in life for granted are really the big things and you just got to be grateful for everything that's going on in your life even though if it's a tough situation I promise you when you get out of it you'll be grateful that you went through it so I plan on getting out of this situation by eating definitely eating a lot more Health like just cutting out a lot of the crap so no more sugar I feel sugar is like the number one cause for cancer it's crazy how the doctors here give you sugar and then other people will tell you not see sugar but definitely cut back on sugar going cut back on sugar I'm going to be doing some immune therapy which is something here in the states that's that's legal but um I'm going to be doing something out of state that's not legal here so we're going to see how that goes so it's crazy cuz the first time I got diagnosed with cancer I was doing like really good in trading and then I just went to complete crap like literally as soon as I got diagnosed with cancer and I was going through chemo I went to like a 3 four month losing streak and then I didn't get get out of that losing streak until I stopped doing chemotherapy but what's crazy is now 2 years later I did chemotherapy and I was on a 23 week winning streak so it literally did not affect me at all it just it just goes to show the growth like in the mindset and pretty much just the growth in two years of play in treading yeah just know anything that you guys set your mind to you could achieve no one could stop you by yourself and your mindset is the most powerful thing that you have so I leave you guys with that it need a p and and uh we just put a bucket in it look oh we just put a bucket in it right now so this bucket is going to pretty much let him sit kind of high we're going to go get ice and be right back all right we got eight bags of ice bro this is going to suck what do you think are you ready see I'm first more all right guys trade update we got literally no sleep yesterday after Jordan after look let me just show you guys my sleep look at this yesterday we got 22% recovery so we fell like 4 hours of sleep we fell asleep at 3:00 in the morning and we woke up at 7:30 in the morning you might be asking but Alex you left Jordan's house like at 1:20 in the morning why' you fall asleep at 3: well you know took another trade you know what I'm saying well not not one of these trades right the account's exactly the same we took another trade you know what I'm saying when you win a trade right you turn $100 to 15,000 you know you get some opportunities out there and um you got to take it when the opportunity is there you got to take it you think I wanted to do that SN no but I'm a soldier all right long story short account let me show you guys my effects look but before that actually let me show you guys the the trade so look the trade right now obviously continue to go I could have literally kept holding this trade right now we'd probably be easily at around 18 19,000 just shows you guys once you trade with the trend all you got to do is [ __ ] set and forget so this trade completely perfectly played out trade next GJ GJ telling you we were wrong we were wrong literally forever EUR us looks like it came back to add another entry after this left head uh left head right shoulder and then we retest so it looks like it's continuing to the downside but now this trade right here now last night as I was um entering other markets and um using proper risk management I wasn't paying attention to these markets last night and we missed out on a on another trade so this trade right here gvp CAD literally exactly how I explained this so we had the left head and the right shoulder we had the break exactly how I wanted to we had the retest exactly how I wanted to and then look at that the move ended up happening last night this is pretty much the entry right here so this was a trade that I ended up missing out it is what it is uh honestly I don't really care I'm not super greedy I'm not really I'm not worried about it you know because we're definitely ahead of schedule currently right now let me show you guys the my effects account before that what time is it it is 8:30 in the morning right so I keep forgetting this so let's look right here so look at the time so if I refresh the time it is 8:29 8:30 in the morning I don't know why it does that but so let me actually sign in right now to the my effect book so I can show you guys so as you guys can see here on the my effect book just hid in the broker cuz I don't promote Brokers so this is the my effect book on the 100 know as you guys can see I'm hiding the broker name cuz I don't promote Brokers right now you guys can see the current balance show them that Equity chart like show them the chart of that market right there look at that [ __ ] that [ __ ] looks like a [ __ ] rocket ship down here you guys can see literally all of the Pips that we have gotten you guys can see our profitability it's 100% profitability because we haven't lost a trade if you would have lost a trade would have blown the account we've taken five trades as of right now every single trade we've taken is a short um our best trade is $8,000 our best trade is 200 Pips uh pretty much everything is pretty cool so yeah now we're going what what are we going to do now we're going to go drift the Ferrari for no reason no we did that yesterday today's another day we just do it again yeah we can enter a new position now so since we technically missed this High entry right here this could be down the next retest of this really ugly left head right shoulder so if I were to draw it out like this it'd be a little ugly but you you know it's like it's like last night's trade like had to do what I had to do you know it was hey it was a profitable trade I'll tell you that any trade that you take and you execute and you come out successful on the other side that's a profitable trade remember that trade of [ __ ] not everybody will understand all right so now this trade right here we're having a pull back to what looks to be like this neckline right here now here is where I'm going to be interested in entering this position this is what the 1 hour is looking like so we're back at this area of Interest level of support level of support now we got a level of support right here and we got to reject this if we reject it give you my entry signal I will then enter this trade right around here so let's just be patient on this trade and I'll update you guys so see you guys throughout the day when a trade knocks take that jum dude trade update 9:23 in the morning all right what is it an hour later look at this [ __ ] exactly what the [ __ ] I just explained literally retest this level to then look for the new entry to sell bro this is [ __ ] crazy if you are not subscribed and you have not joined the ctif community you're missing [Music] out I bet you guys don't know how the [ __ ] to cut a watermelon well neither do I you guys are here watching this video

on watermelon it tastes great let try look try try try try try BR look I do it all the time it doesn't no it doesn't leave me yo so it it's honestly in between you guys I'm not going to lie my nose was stopping me m all right all right now just be careful you guys are going to step what do I get for second place nothing you mean second place second place is the first loser you get nothing that's why you never [ __ ] say yo today day what time is it let me get your phone all right trade update right now 710 in the afternoon we are not trading right now it's what day is it today Thursday Thursday Thursday 70 in the afternoon we're going to play some basketball right now ball up [Music] it's it's all right but when you get all right guys so market update it is currently 12:18 in the afternoon we got to haircut every single Friday you got to look fresh for the weekend for the weekend trades you know what I'm saying come on we take a trade earlier this week come on you guys get the [ __ ] program all right so this week we're actually out of the four markets that we were interested in trading at the beginning of the week two of them played out one of them didn't play out at all and then one of them was a loss if you would have taken every single trade or been interested of taking every single trade even if you would have taken two of the wins and two of the losses you would still be up because of the risk to reward so let me explain so first things first is going to be GBP JPY so GBP JPY you can see at the beginning of the week we're waiting for price to have a pull back into this area to then sell because we're going to have the left head and then the right shoulder to retest the EMA this resistance resistance level to that and sell obviously we were interested in the buys to get to that point but the buys never presented themselves so we never took that byy but you guys can see how this sell of the overall Market which is the real trade actually ended up playing out massively this is a massive move right here this trade right here alone if you would have taken it right around here would have given you 1,000 Pips which is [ __ ] insane for that to happen in one single week so this is GBP JPY this trade did not give us an opportunity so out of the four markets this is the one that did not give it to us and if you did take it it would be a loss next is going to be obviously USD CHF you guys already know at the beginning of the week we were up here we had major moves to the downside guys this is literally been one of the [ __ ] craziest moves I have seen in a very long time we close our trade out over here for a total of a one to4 risk to reward and at the time that was a lot but if I just continued to set and forget and I would have continued to hold this trade all the way down here we would have a 1 to 15 meaning that this $115,000 that we have right now in the account would easily be at 30 no no what the it be like at $60 $70,000 probably even more Hest almost like 100,000 cuz we 10x it so obviously that didn't happen we got out here so this is obviously a win next is Euro USD so EUR USD was the first trade that played out to Perfection we have the left head right shoulder read this the neckline sell this trade would give us a one to two so this played out perfectly and then last but not least is GBP CAD so GBP CAD is just giving us the entry right now on this market we've officially had the break and now we're having the r the retest that we're looking to enter this market so this is the trade that just simply did not give us the opportunity to enter the trade to the downside so those are the four markets that we are we're interested at trading at the beginning of the week definitely a profitable week and this is what we do every single Sunday with my students I literally share with my students every single one of these trades that I'm taking on the 100 to the mail account on Sunday swings if you guys click the link below you guys are going to know what set and forget is truly and how you can get access to these same markets with me every single Sunday because I get on a call with the students and I break down all of these markets right here so every single one of these markets that you see here I get on a call with them and I break down every single one of these markets and out of every single one of those markets I find the top two top three top four best opportunities that the market has to give because if you only Trade One Market you're just limiting yourself to just one type of trading at that very time there's been markets in this watch list right here like literally in this watch list I don't remember the last time I traded GBP and ZD like I could have not traded that pair for 8 months but there could be an opportunity next month where it gives it to to me so if you only trade gbpnzd kind of just cutting yourself short to only trading the opportunities that that market gives you which might not be the best so I have many different markets because I look for the best ones that's going to do every single Sunday with my students where I'm going to be sharing with them the trades that I take on this 100 to the mail account so if you want to join and be part of those calls click the link in the description below we get on a call every single Sunday you join the Discord

I Tried to Turn $100 into $30,000 in 30 Days Trading Forex
Aug 11, 2024

but this right here is going to put the biggest smile on my face the biggest this right here is my new masterpiece it's week four of me turning $100 into a Million last week we were trying to turn $3,000 up to $6,000 the account is currently sitting at $3,000 and at the beginning of the week as soon as we took the trade we almost blew the account this seem good but luckily the entry was very precise and we had very well takeprofit setup and we ended up closing the account at $115,000 in profit all right market update is literally 30 minutes later we are still in the trade so now we're up $5,500 so double the profit of what we originally set for ourselves for that week now that leaves us with a starting balance for this week of $155,000 now the goal for this week is to take $155,000 to $30,000 this is week four of turning $100 into a all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to day it's Day Zero cuz tomorrow's day one tomorrow's day one well it's not day one cuz it's we're [ __ ] week four of the challenge dude so we're on like probably day like 20 we're cuz we're on week four whatever it's day one of the week So currently right now it is drum roll please Sunday whoa Monday Monday midnight so it literally just became Monday 6 minutes ago Miami time right so but it's technically Sunday night so currently right now the account is at $115,000 we have not taken any trades just yet so let me share with you guys the markets that we're going to be trading this week so like always Let me refresh the page what time is it right now Miami it's August 5th 12 a.m. so let's start off the markets this week so last week we had a very successful week we turned $3,000 to $115,000 now this goal's week is to turn $15,000 to $30,000 [ __ ] and honestly I think it's very possible because there's some really good opportunities if we miss one of these opportunities I think we won't have a trade this week but just looking you know based off of my experience in the markets so first trade that we're interested in taking is going to be AUD CAD AUD CAD right now on the daily time frame we are very much bearish the daily time frame has had a very strong move to the downside retest this level sold broken this level retested it this is clearly a level of support one above and a level of support one above if we continue to look left here you can see that it is clearly resistance went under so if we follow the same line we can tell that we're clearly under so we're looking to pretty much so weekly time frame has had a very strong push to the downside we're bearish we're under the structure level and the weekly time frame is under this and then it's under this we also have a weekly Doe so we can easily fill out dogee to the downside but now we go to the 4our time frame and at the 4H hour time frame we have a very very clear uh shift the structure right now this has clearly gone bearish well it is bearish it's lower high lower low but in this structure we have shifted and on the 1H hour time frame we have had a beautiful left head right shoulder retest of the neckline and then now it looks like we are selling if you guys notice every single trade we have taken thus far has had this head and shoulders pattern which works AB absolutely beautifully and this trade looks like we just missed it because it's having the rejection I wanted to enter earlier but rule of thumb I do not take trades on Sunday night so I need take trades on Monday morning London session so technically in about an hour but it looks like this trade is already moving that fast but I'm going to stick to my plan and not take any trades until then simply because statistically proven over the last thousand trades that I've taken taking trades on Sunday night it's not a deal trade will hit your stop loss because the market has to create that Weekly Wick but I'll explain that probably in another video so what we were looking for is for price to come back and retest this EMA retest the Nightline of The Head and Shoulders to them sell we're looking to get an entry right around up here but it looks like it has already rejected and kind of sucks so there's not much I can do I don't really want to chase the trade and then put a stop loss like this cuz then my First Take profit would have to be this point and then obviously if that's my first take profit that is a shitty ass risk of reward if this is my second take profit it's decent but I still don't want to have a stop loss that is like that tight and does not give me enough breathing room so for this trade we're just going to Simply wait for it up here I'm going to put an alarm to see just in case if it does have some type of retracement next is going to be GBP CAD so GBP CAD we've been watching this trade since probably the last three weeks of the challenge last weekly Candlestick we officially had a humongous weekly dogee and I strongly do believe that this week we're going to fail that Wick cuz we have created a high higher low higher high now I do believe we can come back into this area to create a higher low simply continue heading to the upside so we are taking a counter Trend trade and the daily time frame is clearly beish we have high low high low high boom broke structure so now we are bearish we are rejecting round olical level 177 500 and then on the 4H hour time frame we are right around under that 4H hour EMA and that round psychological level what I'm going be waiting for now on this trade is simply a break and retest under this area of interest for price to then be ready pretty much to sell I don't want to sell within this box cuz clearly when we're selling into the box it's rejecting up when we're in the Box it's rejecting up when we're in the Box it's rejecting up but when we're under the box it is setting down so I want to wait for it to get under the box in order for us to be interested in selling I am a master at these boxes I've been putting these boxes on for [ __ ] ever so that's GBP CAD next Euro USD funny enough last week we were looking to sell at this head and shoulders pattern left head right shoulder retest to then sell and now this week we're actually interested in buying so this shows you guys that we react and adapt to what the market shows us and the different opportunities that it has to offer so here we have a very strong push to the upside and now we're looking to have a retest of this level to then continue to buy the 4-Hour time frame has very clearly broken out of what looks to be a very strong bearish Channel I hate using trend lines but it's very obvious this wasn't a bearish channel we broke out of it now what we have to be patient for is this pullback so then we buy so we're just waiting on price to basically have this pullback so we can take this straight to the upside so we have our risk to reward tool ready to go and we have our pullback predictions ready to go so for now we got to set and forget next is Euro GBP Euro GBP is very similar to Euro USD we are clearly bullish we've had a very strong push to the upside this is what this Market essentially looks like right now we've had a very strong push and obviously you can't buy all the way up here yeah you have to wait for a pull back to then buy and if I just bring this back over here it's exactly how it looks like we have the push to the upside now we're just going to wait for this retest to head to the upside on this level of support support and support clearly whenever above or rejecting up so right now we got to wait for it to pull back and on the process of this having this pull back to this level the EMA is also going to then have this little retracement here so then it could get used as support to then head to the upside next is going to be gbpusd so gbpusd is a little bit more clean on the 4our and it's basically I'm predicting for this to do the exact same thing as your USD now keep in mind this is something that comes with experience this is because I've seen this hundreds of times and I simply can kind of almost tell when it's going to happen again but pay attention so you guys can notice the resemblance one pair versus the other so let me show you guys so right now gbpusd it is in this downwards Channel or what it looks like to be this bearish Channel and if you notice on EUR USD it's exactly what we had right here if you notice they look pretty much [ __ ] identical but what happened with your USD it broke out of that bearish channel now in gbpusd we haven't quite broken out of that channel so my prediction is for price to break out of this channel retest it and then head to the upside so technically Euro USD is ahead because it already broke out our waiting is for the retest to go long GDP USD we haven't broken out yet but that's my prediction I'm looking for it to break out of this channel so then it can continue heading to the upside and then last but not least is going to be Euro AUD and Euro AUD is very simple we're at a higher high of this Market I'm just waiting for a retest of this level to then continue this trade to the upside then that I get any more textbook but clearly a very strong level of resistance resistance resistance support resistance resistance resistance whenever we're under a rejecting or whenever we're above rejecting very clean break and retest pair so for now AUD CAD is pretty much the one that is ready essentially right now and it looks like it's already having the movement so the only way I'll be interested in taking the trade once we have that pullback so it's pretty much it probably long explanation damn that [ __ ] took 7 minutes to [ __ ] explain but just market update phone doesn't have battery currently right now it is is 12:14 at night so I'll probably wake up 7:8 in the morning and we'll see you guys then to see what the market has done see you guys tomorrow in the morning all right good morning ladies and gentlemen what an interesting morning Lally the first thing that I woke up to is my phone blowing up the market crash Bitcoin crashed dark Market is crashing this is something that I called a really long time ago simply because it just doesn't make sense when everything is so high like things could go up for a really long time but not for forever everything always needs a correction the Mark is always over do a correction so just to show you guys right now well before anything this is what matters 100 to the mill account we are literally exactly the same no trades have been taken it is currently 9:00 in the morning so 8:55 in the morning just to show you guys over here once again this is where we refreshed it yesterday so it's 900 in the morning so now this Bitcoin Bitcoin crashed today in the morning as soon as the market I guess opened Bitcoin has had his amazing major move this is the weekly time frame my predictions have always been for price to come back and retest this level of resistance and resistance before heading to the upside yes my strategy has worked in crypto previously we got some beautiful buys down here which is absolutely amazing but now to what matters which is the 100 to the mill count trade so if you guys remember last night or for you guys a couple of seconds ago literally I was explaining how I was looking to enter this trade if it would have had a little bit of a pullback into this area so then I can take the sell price never pulled back and we missed out on this major major Market move it had the [ __ ] perfect retest of this everything exactly explained perfectly and we simply missed it because the trade was not at the minor area we wanted it to go to now this is going to happen to us time and time again it's normal it's inevitable this is the importance of having a trading strategy now sometimes you miss these trades sometimes you catch them what do I change in order to continue to catch them nothing because then that's going to affect my win rate on the ones that I should have catched and this is where a lot of you guys make mistakes you're going to miss trades it's okay [ __ ] happens was a big deal didn't cost you anything now you have to wait for the next trade to pop up just like this one which there is one popping up so this trade AUD CAD sadly it has [ __ ] left and we have missed it it is what it is we'll catch another trade this if we would have entered up here we would have easily caught in right now A 1 to six which is crazy next gvp CAD gvp CAD this trade right here we explained it last night that we were looking for price to have the break and then the retest to then sell it's exactly what we did uh the trade kind of left as well didn't have the retest as much as I wanted to but it is what it is I explained that the weekly time frame has to fill that Wick it's exactly what we're doing right now so we missed out on this trade as well the market has been very very volatile right now there's just a lot of fundamentals pushing price but didn't reach it exactly how I wanted to even if I go down to the lower time frame like 30 minute I guess this is it right here but N I would have not even really counted it next is Euro USD so Euro USD we've been waiting for a retracement to this area to then continue heading to the upside no retracement price just continued going to the upside so we could not take this trade Euro GBP same exact thing last night we were at this point and we wanted her price to have a pullback to then head to the upside but we did not catch any trades on this point gbpusd had a little bit of a push to then the bottom of this kind of downwards Channel and now it's retesting this level of support and resistance that is clearly very well respected throughout here so I can't take a trade in here we want to take a trade as soon as it so it it it's been exactly as I drew out I drew this out right so price was here when Market open we wanted to retest this area then have a breakout then have a retest and then this is where we would enter so it's literally following the plan that I anticipated for it I just can't enter the trade here I want to enter the trade once it breaks and retests out and uh last but not least Euro AUD we anticipated for price to come back and retest this level but it just flew so the only trades that I available kind of somewhat soon it's going to be gbpusd and then maybe GBP CAD all right so basically GBP USD and GBP CAD so GBP CAD I just need for price to have a little retracement so this just confirmed closed right now on the 4our like this so the 4-Hour time frame just closed bearish engulfing like that which is phenomenal but I think we should have a little retracement on at least the 1 hour for price to just create real structure so then here's what we would look for our entry to then take this trade to the downside just needed to create something like this left head and then this right shoulder so we can sell so GBP CAD would be the one that we're interested in taking and then gbpusd cuz we actively missed AUD cat which [ __ ] sucks but you guys are seeing it firsthand how simple strategy Works what did you guys thr out today all right guys market update it is currently 8:00 in the afternoon as you guys can see the weather today has been trash as you guys can see it's been literally raining this we're in the [ __ ] middle of a hurricane right now we're Floridians we don't care about a hurricane but I don't want to drive any of the cars in the rain cuz [ __ ] gets thrown on the road I don't want to pop a tire just anything so the rain stopped so now we're going to go hit the gym literally been stuck home all day because of the rain so let me actually show you the markets so right now on AUD CAD exactly what I explained earlier we had a very strong rejection from the neckline of The Head and Shoulders we had the beautiful cell this is where we would have entered we would have gotten out this is what I explained to you guys earlier you cannot enter on just the price having a pullback and you want to ENT enter an impulsive cell it simply does not make any sense just because the move happened and now it's having a pullback you cannot enter an impulsive sell on a trade that does not have any entry confirmations you cannot treat this trade right here with no confirmation as if it were to be this trade right here just because the market had a push from this level of resistance to the downside it makes absolutely no [ __ ] sense so this is where a lot of mistakes were being made in the Discord earlier today with the students and I was literally explaining to them like guys you can't treat you can't treat a pullback as if it were to be the same entry as the actual trade that we took and that's a big mistake that a lot of people were making just because they missed out on the first entry they felt like they had to get into the second one and for those of them that did they lost so I didn't get in because obviously I was waiting for I treat every single trade different I can't treat this entry as if it were to be the same as this one so now as it's having to pull back it's retesting this neckline I am going to be waiting for the break and structure of this 30 minute higher low time frame so basically I'm going to be waiting for the same thing I did here higher high higher low higher high it broke retested this is the entry missed it now I'm just going to be waiting for the same thing here to enter the trade to the downside and just to show you guys right now there is no entries into the trade right now the account is exactly the same we're currently at $155,000 and we have not entered any trades so this is just AUD CAD we're going to be waiting for this break and retest to enter the trade so next Market is going to be gbpusd which we are still inside of this channel just waiting for the breakout retest to head to the upside Euro GBP we've had an absolutely extremely strong bullish day just waiting for a retest to head to the upside GBP CAD on the other hand we have a beautiful confirmation that we have rejected this retest of the shifter structure rejection from the round psychological level 77500 and then on the 4H hour we can see that it's starting to head a little bit up but not quite where we needed in order to enter the trade so I'm going to be waiting for price to retest this EMA and this area and where my alarm is honestly in order for me to enter the trade so earlier this morning we had this line which we wanted to break we were had the break now we're just waiting for the retest for it to then sell and then last but not least we have Euro USD which we've had the break out of the channel now we're just waiting for the retest to head to the upside so the main ones that I'm only focused on is going to the AUD CAD for an entry after it has this shift because the daily does look very nice with this humongous daily DOI I am a lover of these daily dois because I am a firm believer that they always get filled especially when you have the daily time frame bearish and the 4our time frame bearish and the weekly time frame bearish so I'm just going to be waiting for my entry confirmation I'm going to put my little alarm right around here just to let me know that it's breaking that level and have an alarm here just in case it decides to go a little bit higher and then GBP CAD once it has this pool back here then I'll be interested in selling so once again market update 8:05 in the afternoon after this we're going to go hit the gym get back in the gym I've been slacking can't even lie just haven't been feeling the motivation we're [ __ ] getting back [Music] in see what's going to go on oh [Music] oh oh [Music] so right now GBP CAD still waiting for it to have a pullback hasn't had the pullback quite yet a cad it's having the first anal rejection we're waiting for the break under that structure level right there so that might happen soon I might enter I don't know if this 4H hour Candlestick engulf the next two and two and a half hours I'll enter the TR for right now you guys can clearly see no one trades in the account so you guys all right guys what is going on so market update it is currently 1 in the morning so as you guys can see it is 1:11 in the morning not sure if you guys can see it there there you go so right now trade did not close under the area that we wanted to so I literally stayed up to 1:00 in the morning for no [ __ ] reason and the problem is that I'm so invested at this point that I think I'm just going to have to stay up to like 3:00 in the morning waiting for this trade to play out let me actually show you guys what I mean So currently this is AUD CAD as you guys can see right here we're waiting for price to have the pull back here and then the Candlestick to body close under it did not we go down to the 1 hour we did not have a break of structure we go down to the 30 minute we did not have a break of structure so we're still just waiting we we could take the trade here it's not a bad trade it's just a little bit of a highrisk trade so the reason why say we got to wait until 3:00 in the morning is because that might be the momentum that's going to give us that break at that point but I might enter before I don't know I don't know so for this next 4H hour Candlestick to then close we got to wait another 4 hours 3 hours and 47 minutes so let's see we might enter the trade we might not but I'll keep you guys updated if not I just might fall asleep all right guys market update it is currently 9:58 in the morning pretty much 10: in the morning as you guys can see we are locked in so the account right now we have no traits and we have not had the execution on AUD PAD as we wanted to so I'm locked in as you guys can see my chair is facing forward my feet are on the little thingy so I am locked the [ __ ] in let me explain to you guys right here so yesterday we set this 30 minutes shift the structure level so price from where we were rejecting from decided to have another pullback then lendon session and did go and it finally broke the structure so now we're having the pull back into this area and then here where we're actually looking to enter so I just have my R reward tool there doesn't mean that I actually am looking to enter the trade there we had the shift of structure we shifted the structure and now we're having the pull back now and here I need to wait for the engulfing on this market so all I have to do is just wait so this going to happen in the next I don't know 30 minutes 40 minutes I have no idea what I do know is that it is moving I like leaving this here cuz it shows me how much it's moving I think it's going to come in reject that EMA and reject that structure level GB P CAD is crazy the fact that we've been predicting this ship for I don't like we've been predicting this move right here specifically since we were up here we had the left head right shoulder pop up a clip of gvp Cad and you can see right here on the 4our time frame we are literally lining up a left head and then a right shoulder to where this Market we can then have a break a retest to then sell to the downside and then retest this neckline of the EMA 2 weeks ago we've been looking at this person since we started the challenge and we waiting for this specific trade and we [ __ ] missed it and and it it sucks because it's going to happen you're going to dude you're going to look at markets and you're going to wait for a trade to play out to get to your area of interest for 2 weeks and it's going to get to that area of interest and it's going to give you the entry signal and you fell asleep and you missed it but then you know what you're going to stay trading so you're going to wait for it again right another trade comes up you're going to wait 2 weeks for it going to get to your area area of interest it's going to get give your entry your entry signal and as soon as you take the trade straight to your stop loss you're going to wait 2 weeks to miss a trade then you're going to wait 2 weeks to then lose a trade it's just how it [ __ ] works now because I missed this trade this doesn't mean anything it doesn't mean that now I have to change something in my strategy or I have to uh add something new no I simply just missed it now I just wait for New Opportunities so let me show you guys literally we were waiting for this trade to pull back into this area right here to then sell never did it we had the movement perfectly as we anticipated we've had this High we had the pullback literally everything that I've been predicting on this pair for such a long time literally we've been looking at this Market before it even created this red Candlestick right when it created this first one so we've been looking at this market for 3 weeks and it had to move and it is what it is we simply just missed it there's nothing that we can do we just take the same approach to a different market and wait for it to play out gbpusd we still have not broken out of this channel clearly we rejected the top of it and now we're at the bottom of the channel once again we got to wait for that break and retest to go long Euro GBP looks like we are starting to have a Slowdown but still no pullback and then Euro USD looks like it is starting to having that pullback so we just got to wait for price to retest this area down here to then enter the trade so this is actually going to the top of my watch list because we got to wait for it to reach this area to then buy just how it did here just how it did here so we got to wait for it to make it there and then AUD cat is just the first one that I'd be interested in taking the trade so we are currently right now waiting for this Candlestick to reject so s and forget boys we'll update you guys in 30 45 minutes 10: in the morning right now all right so we just got well actually trade update it is currently 2:00 in the afternoon markets haven't even moved I'll show you guys right now what's going on but our Atlanta just pulled up so Atlanta just did a collap with Trump where he pulled up he actually signed one of the paintings that he did I actually have a bunch of artlanta paint throughout my whole entire house but I just got two new posters going to give one to one of my family members are all about Trump and I want to put one on the wall CU I think this is a legendary ass picture and then ARA did it herself let's go oh [

battery oh [ __ ] back it up T put it reverse T sh catches fire set don't forget the next trick all right guys market update it is currently 9:29 in the afternoon I just realized I don't think I've updated you guys in the chart since like 10:00 a.m. I think I could be wrong it's been a long day let me show you guys currently right now AUD CAD right now on the 30 minute time frame so earlier this morning we were having this pull back here and we were interested in taking the position at this point I told you guys that if we get the engulfing I might be interested in taking it but it just didn't look clean enough it just didn't look like it's it if you guys can see we have not taken any trays on the 100 to the mail count it's loed so basically we we never ended up taking the trade at this point right here because it just didn't reject how I want I get rejected but it's not how I wanted to right so if you look at on the 1 hour the 1 hour did have a dogee but no engulfing so it didn't answer it there there 2 hour didn't show any sign of slowing down and the 4H hour just closed obviously as a really strong engulfing so I just didn't end up taking the trade at all obviously played out very well in my favor because I ended up avoiding a loss which is phenomenal because the original trade already played out which is this trade right here so the original trade that we wanted to take was this one and it already played out this second trade that we're taking here is an add-on and it's a higher risk trade and it's a trade that I don't tend to take because the trade already played out so there's no reason for to force another trade into it which would be exactly what this is right here next is EUR USD so EUR USD we're having the pullback we're having the pullback now to this area of Interest I can almost take these counter Trend trade to the downside because as you can see it's clearly forming the left head and the right shoulder and currently if I were to go down to the 30 minute time frame you can see how it's having a very strong accumulation and having UND decision but if you look at the daily time frame you can see how the daily time frame has slowed down so clearly it had a very strong breakout one day of a dogee now we can very strongly fill this so we can almost take this counter Trend trade to this area right around here something like this I don't know I'm going to debate it whether I take it or not it's a little bit of a highrisk trade it is a little bit of a Dej trade but it looks very clean look how clean it looks to fill this right shoulder up to this point so I'm going to decide if I take it pretty soon right next GBP had we already know the trade completely went missed it there's nothing we can do about it and then gbpusd it's still in this channel got to wait for the breakout so pretty much everything else is nowhere near being ready the only trade that I'd be interested in taking is going to be AUD CAD once we have a stronger rejection confirmation from this level of resistance up here and then Euro USD a little potential counter Trend trade from this area to then here to where then we would be interested in then buying from here to the upside So currently 9:31 in the evening let's see if we can enter a trade tonight during London so far no trade and it's Tuesday it's a boring week so far it's been pretty boring like I mean we've done fun [ __ ] but trading wise it's been kind of boring sometimes you got to sit in your hands I I don't want to say we got lucky but we definitely did start The Challenge on a hot week so we were very fortunate to capitalize off of those moves now we got to be realistic on how more often can that happen and maybe we don't trade this week at all maybe we do maybe we'll never know but the market is giving us opportunities as you can see AUD CAD played out in our favor and GBP CAD played out in our favor we just happened to miss them so let's see if we can catch your USD very soon all right guys market update so I spent the morning kind of just focusing locking in diving on this trade to see if I was making the right decision because we have officially taken the most degenerate trade of the whole entire [ __ ] chat the biggest counter Trend trade it's such a d gen trade that I did not risk 100% I risked 20% on this trade so just show you guys currently market update and we are negative about $500 because we literally just entered the trade as the Candlestick just closed right now so yesterday on Euro USD I'm sure you guys can remember that I was anticipating for price to have a sell from this point up here to then reject and then for price to actually make it all the way down here to then have the actual Buy on EUR USD because we're anticipating for Euro USD to make it all the way down here reject this level and then head to the upside since we broke out we never retested it so we are expecting for that retest and here on the 1 hour you can very very clearly see that we are creating a potential left head right shoulder again it's not a confirmed right shoulder and so we don't break under this neckline but I believe what it's creating right here it's such a strong level of accumulation looks like a 1H hour double top 30 minute time frame I see it I almost see it like squeezing into this inwards uh triangle whatever you want to call this again I hate trend lines and I hate all this stuff CU they're very subjective but you can literally see how price is squeezing into this area and I personally believe it's going to have more of a reason to burst down then burst up I could be completely wrong because I don't believe that this area that is rejecting from right now it's going to be the area to continue pushing to the upside I think such a strong move like this has to have a deeper retracement before actually heading to the upside so when I go down to the 4our this 4our Candlestick still has about 3 hours to close and the last one closes a very indecisive candle I think this next one can engulf close under this which then on the 1 hour it'll give us the break under this neckline of The Head and Shoulders if you notice I put my stop loss little bit right above this level because if we pretty much break Above This the trade is just going to keep going to the upside so just to show you guys how much that risk so this is my effect book position size calculator so we're taking Euro USD the account size is 15,000 I rised about 20% on this trade and then I have a 17 pip stop- loss which gave me my lot size of 17.65 you guys can see right now in the account we took a little extra lot because [ __ ] it you know it's a little dj trade you know I mean it's exciting these trades are fun but very stressful like I don't like this this not looking good at all but whatever we didn't risk a lot right we only risk $3,000 on this trade all right next is going to be Euro AUD so Euro AUD is finally having the pullback so this is what we are expecting for Euro USD to do so Euro USD had the same push and we're expecting this pullback to retest this structure level to then head to the upside Euro USD as you can tell same thing just hasn't had that push down quite as far as we wanted to so Euro AUD we are retesting this level all I'm going to be waiting for is a good rejection from this area here the best way I can put it is I'm just waiting for a break above this right here break and retest above that structure level in order for me be to actually be interested in this trade so for right now got to be patient on your AUD and and then lastly AUD CAD which looks like a very solid trade as well I don't know I don't know if I want to take this trade cuz I don't know if this daily time frame can completely close under after it came back and rejected once again this level of support this level of Support over here to then now rejected to head to the downside the only way I would I think I would probably take this trade would be if we get a a nice push like we got to confirm that we're rejecting this area so something like this then come back in here retest it and then I'll enter the trade right at this point right around here so this not super excited about cuz we missed the original trade but I am liking a lot Euro USD which is obviously the trade that we're in right now so keep you guys updated it's 10:06 in the morning currently we are down about $700 $800 actually we're down $1,000 look at you good oh that that doesn't seem very good not good I mean I I called it you know I don't really care um I'm glad that I ended up getting that out of my system I'm a [ __ ] idiot bro like I mean technically we're still in the trade right so it could clearly reject this level right here so I can literally have the same reaction to the downside and then this same reaction to the downside that's why I'm very strategic with my stop loss basement but the trade that I should be taking is at the break and retest from the neck line of The Head and Shoulders like I know this I I know this you know I just decided to want to get involved but I'm not mad doesn't really set us back much in the challenge there's an unnecessary loss well not a loss yet but it's just a trade update so it's just like an hour later from the last time that we took the trade so yeah now we just got to wait and this is what a lot of you guys do a lot of you guys do this a lot of you guys will take trades that you shouldn't be taking but you guys won't put the blame on yourself or hold yourself accountable I know exactly what I did I did the wrong thing now do I accept it 100% you guys when you do the wrong things you don't accept it you're ready to put the blame on on someone's strategy on the markets on anything but yourself that's what once you start having that self-recognition is once you start developing a nonchalant character for trading in the markets and that's how you truly become successful because you realize that your success whatever the outcome is successful or not is 100% because of you not because of another Outsource like I'm the one that clicked the sell button the phone didn't click it just for me so for now set up for good I can't do this yo that's a sign that we shouldn't we took the first [ __ ] loss in the 100 to the m [Music] come [ __ ] man first loss of the 100 to the milk this my fault right like it's nobody else's fault um I decided to take a high risk trade and I knew it wasn't a good trade so like it wasn't good because I I didn't even posted so like that's how you know I wasn't confident So currently we lost $3,000 was exactly what I calculated all within 1 hour and the account right now is currently sitting at $122,400 um is not bad doesn't put us that far away from where we were you guys can see the trade literally as soon as we took it went straight into stop loss so that sucks um um so clearly this trade is not valid so we just have to wait for price to come down here to buy audcad is the one that I am interested in taking though we did have a very strong rejection very strong closure not interested in taking it quite just yet uh I don't want to take any emotional trades or any emotional decisions so I'm just going to wait for a clean break and retest under and then Euro AUD currently we have rejected this level that's why we got to wait for the break and retest to take this trade so yeah sucks right now it's currently 11: in the morning and uh we took the first loss in the3 Mill probably what we'll do now is just wait for these other trade setups if that just continue to go about the day really nothing changes when you take a loss especially the loss that was so stupid like this one nothing should change at all I don't have to go and meditate now I don't have to then uh read a a book noo [ __ ] I've taken a bunch of losses in the past it's just another loss only in that sucks cuz it was a stupid loss so we'll update you guys in the markets what we end up doing and set don't [Music] forget oh [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] lost the trade now we we got to get the roll to the battery died on it you guys have don't know changing your battery on a Rolls-Royce Phantom is not that easy so [Music] got a Rolls-Royce they said it'd be fun they it is fun I can't even lie we got to get that fix literally no luck has a nail you see that big ass nail call me Arnold m ah almost [ __ ] got a crap um [ __ ] with me so you guys can see right here trade update it is currently a $5,000 in profit and you you want to know what's so annoying like I took that unnecessary trade earlier over some dumb [ __ ] literally because I wanted to be part of the counter Trend trade and feel like I'm sniping a pullback I should I should have risked more on this trade and not have the unnecessary loss but whatever we are literally making back the loss right now on AUD CAD exactly how I explained earlier so we had the perfect break we had the perfect retest we had the engulfing exactly where it is I Look to enter every single time and then our take profit is set to this 4our structure point right here which is beautiful and it sucks because it literally looking like the loss that we took on Euro USD is going to be a wick out which is super annoying and so unnecessary and it does look like it's still going to go down so this is just a d trade lesson learned for the challenge but AUD CAD is indeed looking very well and then Euro AUD is having that breakout exactly how I anticipated now we just got to wait for the retest to then head to the upside So currently right now we are up about $4,000 putting us back a little bit over profit where we were before we made that loss back I haven't made it just yet cuz we haven't closed a trade but we're back up in equity within the same [ __ ] day set a foret strategy for you hit the Subscribe button you're going to keep missing out on these trades all right boys trade update before that let's appreciate the beautiful weather of Miami today look at this look at this let's come on let's look at this [Applause] [ __ ] the beauty comes after the hurricane so that shows you guys that if you're going through something hard that's the hurricane that's the dark time or as soon as that hurricane goes through and you make it through it you get this beautiful weather and you get it beautiful in your car when the weather's nice right oh yeah I got I got another car so I got a I just bought a you just can't say that yeah I just bought another car I bought a AMG C63 but I haven't bought it yet so I'm going to go flip with uh coin with Neil flip a coin for 45k or 35k 45k him 35k me so I haven't bought it just yet but Neil gives it to me on my face like my face car is worth money yo but you see how motivation on that [ __ ] was yeah you got to go through the storm to get the weather you got and then you buy a new car and buying your car but trade update currently we are sitting on the account at about $5,000 in profit oh wait no it's still loaded wait for it wait for it $44,000 in profit so we had a beautiful daily rejection Candlestick from this area right here you can see how the daily Candlestick had a pullback and then rejected we go down to the 4H hour I don't like how the 4our did not close under this right here cuz now I could reject this and then come up to this area and then create a right shoulder just like this one and then head to the downside so I'm going to put an alarm right around my entry to let me know that price is indeed coming back to my entry to see if it's then going to go to the downside Euro USD just continuing to the upside daily had a daily dogee I still do believe this is going to head to the downside I believe it's just creating some resistance level through here so we're just going to see if we got Wicked out or if we were actually completely wrong then Euro AUD we're just waiting for this pull back daily time frame had a beautiful daily dogee rejection now we're just going to wait for that Wick pull back into that level to be able to catch an entry it'll also be a little nice 4H hour higher low So currently 7:15 in the afternoon I'm going go take another trade you know what I'm saying so I'll see you guys later tonight like at 10 10:30 so Center for I guess forget the walk sh to the office when you're [ __ ] so I I fig that it's deciding to pull back because it's kind of setting up for London session we're back here in the markets let me just show you guys right so Euro AUD it's having the pull back exactly where we're anticipating it and it's kind of coincidence well not a coincidence but this means that the AUD is getting strong strong right because Euro AUD this is the quote this is this is the base is the quote I don't know I got to confuse that whatever but now on AUD CAD this is going up because AUD is getting strong so it's literally the same move happening on both markets now I'm pretty much taking the same trade because if I take this long position right here and I have it over here that means that I predict that the AUD is going to get weak and if I sell this here to the downside I'm predicting that the AUD is going to get weak so coincidentally enough this pulled back to a very strong level of support and resistance to potentially reject from exactly as Euro AED pulled back to a very strong level of support and resistance where it could potentially reject from to head to the upside so I think this pullback is actually a good thing because it's confirming that price is just having a retracement to create that momentum for the next following session which is going to be tonight there in London So currently right now time update it is currently 12 12:00 so it's pretty much 1: in the morning well not 1 in the morning 12 a.m. so basically we're down about uh 1,400 right now the account is sitting at about $10,000 in equity I'm not going to close it I'm not going to modify I'm not going to do anything I'm just going to Simply set and forget what I will do though is add a position here if it does give me a nice bullish engulfing Candlestick confirmation right at this area so that I can actually take the trade to the upside so if I got a bullish engulfing here I'll take this trade and if a bullish engulfing happens here it should have a bearish engulfing Candlestick here if you look at the if you look at the candlesticks one 2 3 4 red candle right to the outside and then if you look at this 1 2 3 4 red candles it's literally the same move just vice versa so this is how it looks up and this is how it looks down like they literally look [ __ ] identical pin bar doe pin bar dogee bullish bullish bearish bearish doe dogey literally the [ __ ] same move so if it happens on one it's going to happen on the other now the question is should we double dip or should we just stay calm and only have one trade we still got to hit the goal for the week which is 30k and we're about 20,000 shy so we got to get to work so I'll update you guys throughout the night so annoying market update currently right now 9:26 in the morning not good currently we are down let it load let it load $3,000 so [ __ ] man all right so last night price was right around this area up here right on that Candlestick and then we anticipated from that area that we were going to have a rejection which we did we had a beautiful rejection from this area and then did not work and price decided to continue to pull back I don't know how we did not get Wicked out I have no idea but we're still in this trade and I'm I'm not complaining if you go over to Euro AUD we did have that bullish engulfing but if you look at the time 3:00 in the morning I was literally knocked out not going to be up at that time I just didn't really have to cuz I was already in this position so this kind of literally confirms that they both move exactly the same and this one's pulling back so I did not enter this trade this is where I would have entered it and it's kind of crazy because I think it's going to actually pull up to this area and then reject but it's a little bit concerning because if it comes here and then it rejects that means that audcad has to go that little bit more to then reject but I'm debating right I can't I can't even believe I'm saying this this is such a degenerate thing and going against my trading plan cuz this because of this right here look at this bro yesterday we literally got Wicked out for no reason if we show the trade played out pretty much for the couple of more hours it went a little bit more into the stop loss but then boom the actual move happen this is what we're supposed to actually be entering the trade right here at this breaking retest of the neckline which I lowkey want to but I need a better retest cuz that's not an ideal retest but literally look at this literally just because I had a super tight stop loss and it was a counter Trend trade this is why you don't take these generate trades because you don't know when this is going to happen so if Euro AUD needs to come that little bit more to this area to then reject how it did here that means that AUD cat ah oh man stop stop stop stop stop stop stop yeah we're [ __ ] so whatever this we're just going to set and forget might get stopped out very soon Euro USD going to be waiting for a little quick retest to then sell and then Euro AUD going to wait for a rejection from here to now enter the trade so the trade is pulling back a lot steeper than I would want it to and this can probably play out sometime next week so yeah this can probably be sometime next week has not been a very good week but you know what we're still ahead of schedule remember we're on week four so 100 so week one is 100 to 200 week two is 200 to 400 week three is 400 to 800 and then week four is 800 to 1600 2,000 so even if we get stopped out right now we are still ahead by 2 weeks but is that a good excuse to ruin your trading plan that is not a good excuse to ruin my trading plan you know what you're [Music] right trade up there boys we completely forgot so I took the loss on the trade and I said you know what done for the day stupid loss bro I literally just broke my trading plan so this is where the account is currently right now we're sitting at 8,000 900 well technically $99,000 you guys can see here that we were completely wrong in the TR trade it is what it is go to here AUD Cad and we were completely wrong these are the type of losses that I like taking I like taking losses that they completely go in the opposite direction I hate getting Wicked out and the trade pretty much is going straight into profit so I'm going show you guys my fbook as well it's loading by the way I have to have this with me at all times my phone's growing up all day so I'm have to charge it my fbook is currently at so now we officially have like a real win rate real loss rate and stuff so right now we're going to set and forget for the rest of the day we got uh now hold ourselves accountable for every single time we take a loss so every single time I take a loss I have to pay a consequence and I have that exact consequence so it's going to make sense in probably 5 seconds but literally every single time I lose from this point forward I'm going to hold myself accountable cuz I realized that you know what I became successful and I became so consistent and so disciplined because every single time I would do something wrong I would beat myself up for it I wouldn't just brush it off and be like ah I won't do it again if I do something wrong I pay a consequence for it so I then don't go and do that same mistake again and that's what you guys are not doing you guys are not putting yourselves in the position of being uncomfortable so you can then do what you don't want to do so you follow what you have to do and I'm going to do something that I don't want to do but it's going going to force me to do what I have to do and I'm doing this leading by example show you guys how real how legit I am because like as I've gotten like really really successful kind of Forgotten these fundamentals and these basis of things that got me to the point where I am now so these unnecessary stupid losses kind of make me reflect a little bit and I'm always reflecting because I'm always wanting to improve I don't ever think I'm at the top or at the best point but I think this next thing is it's going to be very humbling and it's going to show you guys how real I am about my word and about always is getting better and there's always a way to get better so right now we're going to play a little bit of basketball 7:00 and in like 5 Seconds you guys are going to see what com so you blow the account and then you blow the Porsche the most important thing here is you got to have other rich friends that pull up in another [Laughter] GT3 [ __ ] dude yeah so L literally coming in right now to through the gate I mean I felt it on the highway I was racing a Supra and I missed fourth gear so bad like I missed this so bad I'm like it's not that bad and I'm like I'm like oh [ __ ] this is worse than I thought and then I just stayed in second gear the whole way to here and now it just

moment I just buy it so I bought this thing but then I realized you know what there's a deeper purpose to this car and I'm going to explain to it in just a second once you guys see this car because this is the car that's going to hold me accountable to whenever I do something wrong this is all going to make sense in just one second so bear with me I have owned Lamborghinis Ferraris Porsches rolls-royces McLaren mlar bro McLaren how can I forget about that but this right here is GNA put the biggest smile on my face the biggest don't show them just yet this right here is my new masterpiece

don't want to do this but if I don't follow my trading plan I will no longer be able to drive a [ __ ] Ferrari or a Porsche I'm going to probably be driving some [ __ ] like this so I'm going to keep following my trading plan so I don't end up in a [ __ ] car like this please turn [Music] on what name should we give it should it be a he should it be a her come on come on work way up watch what do you guys know about this we profit of Trader knows how to do this [Music] [Music] colia col colia really that looks looks sick how do you do it just praised one side the side the most the most important how the [ __ ] the important the most important you like it I like actually sounds really good this is not my security right this a student but these guys are big as [ __ ] bro go all right so like so so this is this is called a money true right as like many people like probably know um but it wasn't the point of that it's like a money CH just so happens to be that way the point is like I was explaining how Alex is like famous in his own world right and the trading world in the niche but as far as like I you know like not like LeBron right you're not like world you know what I mean like you're world but it's different right so the point is that I see right he's doing the cigar thing he's doing like I'll be watching him cuz he's he's a good example like in the community and just in general and so the point of this plant right is that as it stays in this pot it'll grow but it comes to a point where this thing will die because the pot is small so it's just like in life right it's not always about it's a people you surround yourself with whether they are making more money than you they're more famous than you they have better Spirit than you whatever it is it the point is that you're you're you're growing this needs to be in a bigger pot in order to keep growing and I can show a picture I have like three of these shits in my house Li that's deep that is really but it was it was on my heart for you bro for real I believe like you know you've had time you've had time your tree will actually grow like full all together if you do things really fast it'll grow tall but it takes a while to grow the bottom doesn't have a lot of support right it's just like in life you know when you're when you're going through you too fast you going have distra I get it I get it I get it another pod boy we got two people that got shot this guy got shot I was going to do this live but I I just couldn't wait cuz I've had I had before like I had money like locked up in trade locker before and like it glitched and I couldn't get it out you're like so you're going to withdraw 100,000 right now no no congratulations this my whip you know all right yeah we only got space for two oh oh yeah let's just push it let's push it it's [Music] just finally got home from podcast with the students it's currently midnight about to be Saturday technically so very long Friday did the podcast with the cars drove literally the car all day trust me I learned my lesson and I'm going to follow my trading plan cuz I don't want to drive that piece of [ __ ] anymore and the [ __ ] dope part is that I literally have to park it somewhere here in my house and I have no parking for it and I got to figure out that mission probably just thr in the back of the garage cuz I don't plan to drive it anytime soon cuz I don't plan to break my training plan anytime soon so you going to Contin to see this car so let me know a name of what I should call this car because it's going to be in the series until we complete it and at the end we'll probably just blow it up but I want to do a little quick recap on what the markets have looked like so EUR USD at the beginning of the week we anticipated for price to have a pullback to this area of Interest we're still quite on the way there we did have this strong rejection Candlestick which ultimately would have given us the trade that we entered on EUR USD and it did did wake us out for then the trade to almost hit our takeprofit then Euro AUD we completely avoided this loss on this breaking retest even though we had the pullback exactly where we wanted to this is a trade that will definitely be interested in taking next week on the series AUD CAD you guys already know this thing was just completely unacceptable broke the rules here chasing a trade simply because we missed the first one for from here we felt entitled to then entering on this one bit Us in the ass GBP CAD played out perfectly just was being very skeptical and being very selective of the trade that we would take and then gbpusd never broke out of this downwards Channel looks like it's going to do that for next week and let me show you guys the my effect book of where the account is currently sitting at because we're still technically ahead of what we're supposed to be in the challenge but you know kind of sucks being set back couple thousand aage for no reason you guys can see that this is a real account the account is currently at $8,000 and you guys can see down here in these stats how we had seven total trades and our profitability right now is currently a 70% Maj literally every single trade that we have taken has been shorts so we have not taken any long positions so again it looks like we're being a better seller than a buyer so good data to know and I'd say this week out of all the markets that we analyzed technically two of them went in our Direction kind of more or less and then the others just simply did not give us an entry not the best week in trading and we did manage to still stay up and obviously not blow the account completely because we're being selective with the risk management and like always every single one of these trades I break down with my students in the Sunday swings literally the students that were with me earlier from the podcast they have been on their own journey of turning $100 into mil cuz they just following mine one of them turned $100 into 20,000 and another turned $5,000 into $160,000 or the students that I did the podcast with today first how did you take the 4K to the 100 okay okay I had 49 like 4,800 and I and I said you know um my goal this week is 10K that was my goal is 10K and I ended up getting to 13k were you taking the same trades as me or your own trades I I had taken a couple of your trades and then I was actually taking counter Trend trades too that's how I was kind of like scaling the DJ trades the DJ one what would you say to people out there that want to become successful in trading by flipping an account and not going the prop route like what like what would be the right way to do it I'd say going into a personal Journey like that it's really emotional having your emotions right first and then knowing you will take losses so you may have a good four weeks and then where you lose 50% of the account but you have to know that as long as you're standing with your trading plan and learning from your mistakes think anybody could do it that has the interest in passion they're literally following the same trades that I doing every single Sunday I'm breaking down with them and it's giving them these results because they get on a call with me and they find out these pairs in real time when I'm interested in taking them exactly where I'm looking to enter exactly where I'm looking to exit so if you want to know more about set and forget and how how I can pretty much PR predict these things all the time watch the link in the video description below because it is literally going to explain to you what set and forget is and how it lets me get results not so much like this week but how I can still predict the markets now the execution now that goes you know factors in the the time frame that I'm in uh the time zone of the actual trade and that's something that is part of the battle of trading and wherever you are so if you guys want to join c community and get access to these trades make sure you guys click the link in description below now what we're going to do is fall asleep for about 4 hours because we have a very long trip to the Bahamas tomorrow on my boat like comment and subscribe and I'll see you you guys next week take care guys

I Tried to Turn $100 Into $1,000,000 in 37 Days Trading Forex
Aug 18, 2024

so I was going to say something and say some words of Courage but all I have to say is set him forget that's all I got to say it's week five of me trying to turn a $100 into a million day trading last week we ended up taking two unnecessary losses because I broke my trading plan you good oh that that doesn't seem very good that's why we have the Punisher for every single time that I break my trading plan has to drive this car for 24 hours last week the account was at $155,000 and we were trying to take it to 30,000 but now we are left off with $99,000 because we lost $6,000 last week on two crazy trades that we broke our trading plan on so annoying market update currently right now 9:26 in the morning not good currently we are down let it load let it load $3,000 so [ __ ] man and last week we learned a lot from those two losses those losses were Lessons Learned for now this week to take these $99,000 that we have in the account up to $18,000 let me tell you I see some great Market OPP o I smell like ass let's go to the markets and go see these good opportunities let's go good morning ladies and gentlemen it is officially week number five turning $100 into a million a [ __ ] you got to have to oh you heard it you're going to have to edit some more major cracking noise yeah this week we got a make up for last week's [ __ ] [ __ ] slack all the catch chairs you got to blame yourself you got to hit your chair we actually got a new chair by the way so this chair I'm going to auction it off for $5 million cuz I've made over $5 million trading in this chair so whoever buys it can also make $5 million HS in this chair we're going to build that chair probably today or tomorrow it's week number five we're back at it all right guys so this is week number five starting balanc right now of the challenge oh by the way if you guys see think that I'm red it's because I went to bimin on my [Music] [Music] boat 2 hours to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the United States to the Bahamas we crossed this right here and this is the from Miami to Bahamas that is the ocean with no name or maybe it has a name I don't know but the point is that we crossed it we got sunburn but now we're back this week starting balance for the week is going to be drum roll please $ 8,949 so last week we took two losses on the challenge which absolutely suck there were unnecessary losses and we paid the price for those losses which is our new vehicle that we have gotten which which is the Volkswagen and the name is this right here I don't know the name yet we're going to decided by today or tomorrow so editors are going to edit it in and every single time I break my trading plan I have to drive that Beetle for 24 hours and whether I win or lose if I take a trade against my trading plan and I win I still have to do it because I broke my trading plan and if I take a trade and I lose I still have to do it because I broke my trading plan holding myself accountable taking myself back to the roots so this week we actually have some interesting markets some repetitive ones from the last weeks and then we've actually added some cryptos into the chart because I'm actively looking to invest into some type of crypto but we'll probably drop that later throughout the day so let's start off with pair number one is going to be gbpusd so gbpusd as of right now on the weekly time frame we are currently having a beautiful retest of this previous structure level right here very strong double weekly dogee and clearly this move right here is bullish on the weekly time frame and we can anticipate a push for the upside if I simply get this line chart right here and I take it to the structure points which are the bodies of these candlesticks you can very clearly see how well structured this looks any textbook trade will tell you that that right there is setting up for a buy it simply makes more sense for this trade from this point right here to head to the upside versus to the downside that's all we're trying to do at the end of the day with this challenge especially after two weekly does but you then go down to the Daily time frame and we can clearly see that we are under this very strong level of support and resistance and also this EMA which can indicate to us that the daily time frame can potentially have a rejection to this point right here and then when you go down to the 4-Hour time frame the 4our time frame is kind of in the middle it's kind of rejecting now it's breaking above I personally want to take this trade as a buy with the higher time frame of the weekly so in order for me to do that I would have to wait for this time frame to body close above retest and then head to the upside cuz that is literally exactly what it did right here we broke up retested and headed to the upside whenever we are under we head to the downside whenever we are on the upside we head to the upside whenever we're above we head to the upside so in this case I got to wait for it to get to the upside if not I'm going to be looking for some potential cells once we kind of break out of this little inwards triangle so I mentioned in the last uh 100 to the middle challenge that I hate trend lines that trend lines are subjective trend lines you can literally put them from Wick to body body to Wick Wick to Wick body body and it's just extremely subjective and there's no real strategy behind trend lines it kind of just gives you an idea of what the market is moving like is it moving in an upwards channel in a downwards channel is it moving in a triangle like is it consolidating into one spot where it's going to potentially break out but I would not ever use a strategy based off of trend lines so for all all of you guys are asked on why I don't use trend lines it's because it's so subjective for example I can literally use the trend line from Wick right let's say we started off from this Wick so then let's say we're going to use this Wick as a continuation or if you do it like that this looks completely different or if you put it to the highest Wick then it looks like this or you do it to it to that Wick it just looks completely different but then let's say we do it to the bodies and we do it to this body right here oh yeah it broke and retest it out or if you do it to then this next body and it's like oh it's breaking out to the upside it's just too subjective right so I don't really like using it as a confidence I just kind of use it to get a visual visualized understanding of where the market is actually squeezing into so basically I use this trend line to identify this market right here that the only way I will be interested in selling is if we have some type of breakout like this which realistically all that matters it's going to be a break and retest of this structure point right around here so looking for the temporary cells they can be shortterm cells from this point to then this point right around here and then down here we can potentially be interested in buys to execute over the long run or we we can just wait for the break and retest above to then take this trade to the upside that's GBP USD next is going to be nzdusd so I [ __ ] take this [ __ ] because I always analyze the markets on Sunday with the students cuz I got on a call on every single Sunday with my students for like 2 hours where I literally break down every single one of these markets so look you guys can have an idea I don't only trade just these markets right here I analyze all of these markets right here here and out of all these markets I find the best trading opportunities in them and which one have the highest probability in going in One Direction versus the other using my strategy and by the time that I'm done with that call that's 2 hours I'm [ __ ] drained because there's thousands of students that join they ask a bunch of questions and I'm always like all right we'll start this series on Monday right we'll start it tomorrow don't want to start it Sunday night cuz I'm just tired the energy is not there and then this [ __ ] happens where the trades play out right before I can even begin on Monday so this one yesterday we've identified nzdusd that it was retesting this beautiful level of support and resistance so clearly whenever we're above we're going up whenever we're under we're going down whenever we're above we're going up clearly we're above and all we were waiting for is for price to body close above this structure point right here so a body closed structure point right around here then we would be interested and a buy so we would have entered this trade right around here but obviously it played out extremely fast which kind of sucks because you know you guys can't see it I personally didn't catch it cuz it was very late I already know students in the Discord caught it because there have different time zones all around the world and you know by when I'm sleeping they're awake so currently right now what I'm waiting on nzdusd in order for me to enter this trade safely is going to wait for a retest of this structure level so the ideal entry would have been here but now the only way I could enter is if we have this retest to then head to the upside so I have to be very patient on this trade next is going to be nzdusd this is going to be a absolutely beautiful trade so you guys can tell here on nzdusd we are bearish on this daily time frame because we body a close under that structure point and then the weekly time frame is bullish you can clearly see that the weekly time frame had a high a pullback and then here can have uh potentially have a push to the upside daily time frame we are clearly rejecting this level of resistance resistance can now potentially be used as support and what a coincidence we also have that daily EMA so we've had a very strong push and the pullback has started to slow down right around this area now this is setting up a absolutely beautiful trade that is going to be once we body close Above This Zone then once we have the retest we can enter this trade now what's that going to look like that's going to look like a very nice juicy daily bullish engulfing Candlestick then after that bullish engulfing Candlestick all we have to do is wait for a little quick retest to then take this trade to the upside this is by far going to be a very very clean and solid trade as of right now from what I can tell it's already having a reaction but we cannot buy right into resistance this is clearly a level of resistance it's push price to the downside so we can't just buy right into that we have to confirm that once price is broken above that we retest it and continue heading to the upside next is going to be GBP CAD we analyzed this last week for selles and we missed it but this week we are interested in now buys because that was the counter Trend trade pullback now we can be interested in taking the trade to the upside you got to be realistic and ask yourself after such a strong weekly bearish Candlestick like this do you think the next week is just going to completely engulf that probably not it's just not ideal it's probably going to need one weekly dogee Candlestick of just slow move here and then the next week we can potentially have the push exactly how we did right here this pulled back two candlesticks one week a chilled then the next week it then had the push the exact same thing but now here we just have to be extra patient so for that I'm going to be waiting for price to have a very clean break and retest to head to the the upside on this market right here next is going to be Euro USD which we're analyzing last week as well to keep it very simple we took the degenerate cells on this market right around here and we got stopped out but now we're going to continue to wait for the pull back here we're not going to force this trade and once we get here then we'll be interested in the Buys so at this point we'll be looking to then buy this market and then the next markets are a Euro AUD and Euro GBP but they're like so far out from being like tradeable that there's no point in wasting time actually breaking them down so that's exactly what it's looking like let me show you guys the my effect book to start off the week so as you guys can see this is a real account you can tell by the starting balance that we are $ 8,449 and you guys can tell down here that currently we have a profitability of a 71% meaning that 70% of the trades we win 30% of the trades we lose and 100% of the trades that we have taken have been a short so we have not taken any long positions so far in the challenge and our average duration on a trade is 20 hours and 48 minutes this is just this is actually longer before but simply because the losses that we took were obviously fast you know we pretty much entered a trade within the day we got stopped out that's why that time actually went down a bit because you know it was a bit higher it's almost like 2 days but I guess because the losses it average it out a little bit differently but yeah this is day one of the [ __ ] week five the goal is to take these $99,000 pretty much up into $118,000 which sucks because that literally just puts us about $3,000 above last week's starting balance so this week what we're basically doing for the artist to go for this week is to recuperate what we lost all of last week and just put us a tiny bit of So currently right now it is 851 in the morning and let's see where today takes us all right so we just ordered a new chair so I've had the same chair for about I don't know like a year the last chair that I had I made over a million then I got rid of it so now you have it and now this next chair I've already made over $10 million so now I'm going to get rid of it now this is a new chair with my goal is to make $25 million so the previous chair was a like a it was Shaquille Neil's chair it's a really big comfy office chair really bad for my lower back so hopefully this is more comfortable this is not an ad like I'm not even going to promote them I just want to see if it's actually if it's actually comfortable I'm going to obviously shout them out and [ __ ] but I have had I think 15 different office chairs and none of them last more than a week just because they suck the last obviously the two that I just mentioned were the best ones and I stuck with the longest but if I use it for 2 3 days and I don't like it I literally just throw it away so we're going to build this [ __ ] real quick it's black I thought I ordered it white [Music] passes the vibe check I know how does it look looks like a regular chair does does it really yeah I mean it looks like a regular office chair um looks like a car center chair that's what it looks like yeah I feel like a [ __ ] feel like a nin to F in this [ __ ] I definitely feel like my par is better though so it least like this does hug the [ __ ] out of me but then it doesn't stay stuck what do you think hey hey what do you think you have like a collection of chairs going on in here yeah so this is uh your guru's chair this is your mentor's chair right here this is what they look small and soft cuz they're small and soft see the connection there so this is the old one right we made $10 million in this chair now is this going to be the chair where we made $25 million honestly I don't know yo but now that I'm sitting here it's it's actually feeling very very comfortable like I feel like I can actually [ __ ] pull up here I don't know like my arms aren't super down let's see how it feels do a quick trade update so right now currently it is let's use this phone it is currently 857 who can't show you guys a new car whoa Alex got a new car interesting oh let me tell you this right now I got more than a new [ __ ] car I can't say I can't say all I let's just say I'm going crack the [ __ ] internet you know what this is a hint right here this is a hint right here if you know you [ __ ] no remember Tesla I I I don't know I don't know trade update so it's currently 8:57 in the evening or in the in the night oh this is already oh this is already a problem all right we're going to put it lower we're in here all right Perfect all right so trade update we have gbpusd as the number one pair so obviously earlier we were looking at these counter Trend trades and we did not take them simply because it did not have the break and retest under the structure level like I mentioned so we're simply going to continue to wait for that in order to take this counter Trend trade if we decide to if not we're going to wait for the break and retest above to head to the upside next is going to be nzdusd where where we've had the push very strong daily bullish engulfing Candlestick now in order for me to enter this trade I simply need to wait for this next daily Candlestick to have a pullback to this area so I can actually find an entry so it'll look like that on the daily a daily Wick then on the 4H hour it'll look just like a little more of a 4our pullback retracement into here to head to the upside so actively waiting on that USD CAD we've had a very nice daily bullish engulfing Candlestick rejection of the EMA not as strong as I want it to close I would want it to close stronger but we got to do what we got to do and then we have a somewhat of a shift the structure but I wanted to break above this and then have the retest just need more confirmations and then lastly GBP CAD we're going to be waiting for a better break and retest above so technically right now the only one that is actively looking close to being ready is USD Cad and the GBP USD so just to show you guys actively right now we have no trades on the account and it is 9:00 p.m. EST I don't believe any trades are going to be ready tonight in London session it's still very early so we'll probably have to check back in in the morning tomorrow and let's see what happens then so I'm going to test out the chair throughout the whole night and [ __ ] I thought was [ __ ] I thought the same I thought the same thing earlier [ __ ] I was going a bu we test it out and then we'll let you guys know how it is tomorrow check in in the morning all right guys trade update so day one with the new new chair I don't know I don't know if you guys are understand but there's a really big importance of the office chair it's like I spend more time on this chair than in my bed so it's a very big deal that you have the right and ideal chair because this is what's going to make you feel comfortable so you make the [ __ ] [ __ ] money you know what I'm saying currently right now trade update it is currently 10:19 in the morning so last night kind of like I mentioned we weren't going to be interested in taking any trades the account is currently still sitting at the same balance we haven't taken absolutely no trades but we might take a trade in the next 40 minutes so pay attention First Trade is going to be USD CAD where currently we are having the little pullback that I mentioned very nice daily bullish engulfing rejection Candlestick the 4our is pulling back exactly how I would love for it to pull back and it looks like we're closing with a 4our bullish engulfing Candlestick obviously we still have 2 hours and 39 minutes into the that Candlestick closes for me to enter this trade right now I literally just need this Candlestick to body close above that neckline right there cuz it created pretty much a double bottom and then it would be the breakout of that double bottom and pretty much confirm that this might be the area where it could push through this zone right here now it is a higher risk trade because I'm technically buying right into this level of resistance clearly it is used as a level of resistance and it is respected all through throughout here so the ideal trade is actually once it breaks above it then it retests it then this is where we should be entering when we use this as a support so it is a bit of a higher risk trade but [ __ ] it now it's not a trade that I'm breaking my rules keep in mind I am following my rules I'm not taking a cter trade I'm buying at an area of Interest I have my entry signal everything that I look for in a trade Trend everything now it's just a higher you guys got to understand the meaning of that there's a big difference in between a highrisk trade and a trade that does not follow your trading plan taking a highrisk trade doesn't mean that you're breaking your trading plan the way I grade my trades in my trading plan I can give it a so I every single trade is graded right it's either graded 100% 90% 80% 70% based off of how many confluences we can add into this Market to make it make more sense that it's going to go in One Direction versus the other now if it's a very low graded trade that means that it's a higher risk trade so let's say for example this trade has a total of five confluences right that would be a 50% grade which in the US that's a d popup here the grading system in the United States of America this is what I barely graduated high school with so 50% is a bad grade which means that it's a higher risk trade now let's say we were to get 80% on this trade in terms of points and you know things that we were to add to confluences now this has a now now it's not as high of a risk trade because you have more confidences for it to go in One Direction versus the other so this is a higher risk trade because it doesn't have that many points does that [ __ ] make sense makes sense all right if you understood let me know in the comments below but the point is that we're looking to enter this trade very soon next is Euro AUD so I know this wasn't on the watch list earlier this week but we just added it right now well it was at the bottom of our watch list but we just didn't prioritize it cuz it didn't look that clean now we're actually going to implement it I don't love the daily time frame simply because we're bullish but we are under this very strong level of resistance resistance resistance support resistance clearly whenever we're under we're rejecting whenever we're above we're rejecting to the upside and right now we're clearly under I love how the 4H hour is bearish and it's creating these very clean lower low and lower high legs now we have a pull back right into this level of resistance how it did here break retest and we can expect that sell break retest and we literally expect that same [ __ ] sell did you see here two little Candlestick pullback two little Candlestick Bull Pack boom boom boom boom that's what the [ __ ] we can expect to happen now I could be wrong but this is what I'm going to look for in order to enter this trade so in order for me to enter this trade I just needed to have a better engulfing so I needed to just like reject that area again and if it closes with an engulfing like this I'll pretty much just enter that trade it'll be very clean and very solid so what I'm going to do is put an alarm under that structure level so I can know when it's going to body close under next gbpusd had the move so obviously we were looking for shorts yesterday the shorts never broke and retested under this area right here how I just mentioned so what happened we avoided that lost patience [ __ ] pays patience pays you have to have patience if we had have taken another one of these trades we would have literally lost we didn't lose cuz we're patient so this right here is a prime example of why you need to wait now this is where we are going to look for buys now the buys are obviously a little bit far not even going to focus on that nzdusd which is a trade that we had for last night the trade never pulled back as far as we wanted to to enter the trade so it did end up having the move exactly how I anticipated which [ __ ] sucks so literally out of all the markets that I've been predicting I've been pretty much calling literally every single move so I'll update you guys in the next hour or more or less if I end up taking USD CAD or Euro ad and today I have my swim shorts on you know might go out on the boat today cuz uh we got nothing else to do so literally I don't know 5 minutes later this is currently almost breaking breaking the neckline so you guys can see how it's flickering right now it was just breaking above that neckline but we still have 27 minutes in order to actually enter this trade so like you see it's actually like flickering through like about a break above but we cannot enter a Candlestick if it has not closed this if it were to Clos like that bet I enter but it has 27 minutes to actually close so this right now for all I know it could be creating a Candlestick like this it could be creating a a big wick or it could be creating a I don't know right I have to wait for the 30 minutes to close to see how this closes so this where a lot of Traders make mistakes that the enter trade-off of how that Candlestick is forming right now when it's not a real Candlestick you can't count that as a bullish Eng golfing because it's not a bullish Eng golfing until it doesn't close look so look that right there you guys would enter off of that Candlestick and call it yeah poition golfing it's like well no it hasn't closed it's and in the next 30 seconds it can literally just and be something completely different so we'll update you guys in 30 minutes all right guys so I'm on camera Duty right now so I have to step out real quick but what I'm about to show you guys is literally one of the lessons that it took me probably a year or two to really accept it and understand and become patient and I'm just showing it to you guys on this video so easily and it can go right over a lot of your heads if you're not in the right head space to pay attention and learn from this because I like it's not about how much money you can make it's about how much money I could save you by just avoiding voiding these stupid mistakes and you're going to make more money by avoiding these stupid mistakes because you're going to have more money to bet and risk by not losing money on these stupid things look at this so this as you can clearly tell is about 15 minutes from when we were last looking at the charts you can see there's 12 minutes left in the Candlestick and you can see how this did not stay above it's exactly what I said you cannot base a trade off of the Candlestick that has not been fully closed yet this Candlestick has Clearly Now rejected has created a fake push and that's exactly what I said for all I know this Candlestick could be creating a Candlestick just like this one that's exactly what it did so Alex of four years ago would have taken a loss here because he would have entered off of that push thinking that that Candlestick was just going to completely ripped through the [ __ ] screen but no that's not the case you have to wait for the Candlestick to close and look at that we avoided a unnecessary draw down right cuz let's say that this does that push from the upside we avoided unnecessary draw them so you have to wait for your entry confirmation so for now the next step that I'm going to be waiting for is just same thing just going to be waiting for a body closure Above This retest and head to the upside so I think it's proper to say that we should go spend the day at the boat we got nothing else to do today all right guys trade update so that is exactly how the Candlestick has closed as you guys can see a new Candlestick has just opened and we have 55 minutes for that one so yeah let this be a lesson uh for waiting for the Candlestick to close you can't take a tradeoff of an impulse and that right there is what experience gives you so that right there shows you why experience pays now this is something that took me like two years to really really get so don't let this go over your head pay attention so we're going to check back in probably later today just waiting for another retest of that the other markets are exact same spot kind of slow day in the markets so let's go out on the boat today and uh set I forget all right guys trade update it is currently 4:37 in the afternoon so the daily time frame Candlestick is about to close as you guys can tell we're all sweaty right now because we're trying to move the Punisher it stopped working so we thought it was gas it did not run out of gas we went to go buy a jug of gas brought it back f it up we pulled like pulled it you know if you cars that are manual if you pull it you jump start it throw into second first nothing I think there might be something with the spark my opinion I'm not a mechanic but I've [ __ ] up a lot of cars in the past and that's what I think is going on so they're going to take it to the shop now next to my Rolls-Royce Phantom next to my Porsche GT3 and next to my what are the cars in the shop parking lots looking a little yeah I know it's looking little empty right I feel like I feel like one of these wannabe Guru traders that are trying to blow up right now like I feel like them right now like dude I only have one Ferrari I only have one mayback and I only have one $5 million house and only one $200,000 AP got to get them rookie numbers up buddy [ __ ] I feel like such a [ __ ] all I can say is that next video I mean I hope it's next video cuz we're giving them blue balls now yeah no it's going to be next video so all I got to say is next video I'm going to crack how do I say this all I got to say is that next video I am not going to disappoint this driveway will no longer be empty trust me believe me believe me so now we're going to push it back into place oh and the Cyber truck separate trick right now is getting service so we have four cars getting service right now that's why driveway is looking kind of weak but next week it's going to be on fire uh this first the car back in trade update let me show you guys currently the trade that we were looking to enter earlier never gave us that bullish engulfing we never entered the trade we avoided a loss by simply remaining Patient next is gbpusd price never came back and gave us the pullback nzdusd is gone the other trade we're looking to enter is Euro AUD which we have not had the rejection Candlestick that we're looking for so as of right now no trade for the rest of the day now we're going to look for to enter maybe early London session tonight so stay stay [Music] tuned all right so we just left Jordan's house right now just to check up on him and see how he's doing Jordan is getting better it's just you know it's slow recovery it's his third time doing the surgery so his body just takes longer every single time to recover but we're going to come back later do an ice bath with him so you can kind of just get rid of the information and swelling now we're going to go hit the gym I haven't hit the gym in like 5 days oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] we're good oh oh that's Miami fa it was just raining a block before now right here it dries I ifess nothing ever happen this right here this is our drift Street this so you guys don't know I'm actually legally blind I I was negative 750 in my eyes I did lasic on both eyes but I didn't recover 100% so I'm probably like negative 1.25 right now [Music] ready never does Justice [Music] [Music] I [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [ __ ] trade update guys trade update it is currently 1:00 in the morning right now so dude I've just been tired like every single day that I work out I get really tired later throughout the day but trade update looks like I stayed up for this time [ __ ] nothing I hate staying up to late and literally not entering a position that I would want to enter let me just show you guys so currently on Euro AUD you guys can see I've been waiting for a rejection from this area and we did but like always as soon as the Candlestick rejects I always wait like for a little bit in order to to confirm the entry and then pretty much we just started to have push back up also we were not in session you can see down here that it was not right before London session I always look to enter a trade right around this time which is about to be 1:00 a.m. ideally now I don't always have to do it but it's where I have the best probability trade so obviously avoided some draw down on this position I'm still actively interested in entering it I'm just going to probably wait for now another rejection from up here how we've done here in the past rejection will make me want to enter this trade USD CAD obviously the daily Candlestick closed under so we avoided that loss to Perfection I still want to enter the buy but once and only we manage to break and retest above this so something like this and I'll be interested in entering this position which honestly could happen this week just having a beautiful 4 Hour lower low so if it does shift would look perfect and then yeah pretty much everything else is just waiting for the deeper retracement gbpusd deep retracement to buy nzdusd we are having current oh my God what the [ __ ] oh wow I just saw this right now so [Music] nzdusd I'm actually laughing because one of my friends called me earlier he's like yo what should I do with nzdusd I entered earlier this week Sunday night when you sent it out on Sunday SS this is one of my friends that I went to high SCH with literally one of the only close friends that I have outside of you know my my team and he told me he's like yo should I close nzdusd or do I hold I'm like dude if you hold it can have the risk of having a pullback I don't think you should hold I think you should close he's like nah nah no no I'm going to set him forget I'm like brother you have to know when the set him forget and when to not set forget this is not the time you don't want to like not close this trade and I'm laughing because I know he is I know I'mma call him I'mma call him yeah so I'm not friend that I'll call you a 100 times I don't give a [ __ ] y yo you're sleeping have you seen your trade yeah [ __ ] you bro [ __ ] [ __ ] me I told you bro you tell me to Hell a pullback not a whole [ __ ] move straight down that's what I told you bro I told you I was going to have a pullback bro you don't [ __ ] listen to me dog what do you think you told me set and forget no no no no no no no no I told you don't set and forget this trade it's going to have a pullback you didn't listen to me bro yo no no I literally told you bro I'm like yo it's G to it's going to have the pullback if you keep holding the trade you're probably going to get stopped out dude no I know I really don't care and I'm really going to tr to figure I I don't care anymore oh all right that's on you all right I'll let you know that next trade [ __ ] he didn't listen to me he you guys you guys don't get it you know but it's funny cuz he he doesn't trade he's just like bro dude you you motivated me so much off off of your Instagram stories that I just deposited 500 bucks he ran it up into like 15,000 and then he's like you know I'm going to take these 15 to like a 100 I'm like yeah you sure off of what you don't know how to trade he's like yeah but I just copy you I'm like dude that's not how this works you just you got to know so yeah so back to the charts now clearly ndd USD is now having a much deeper retracement than I anticipated and I'm actually liking the buys I just have to wait for a solid rejection of this level uh in order for us to enter this trade so I'm actually going to move this Market to the top with the other ones because I'm very interested in it next is GBP CAD no pull back back your USD having a push without retracing where I wanted to and then your gvp not interested so basically USD CAD waiting for the breaking retest above Euro AUD waiting for a rejection and then nzd USD waiting for a rejection so yeah guys that is pretty much it it is currently pretty much 1:00 in the morning I am going to knock out probably in the next 30 to 45 minutes maybe I just sit here in front of the computer watch YouTube videos I get educated on a lot of stuff and uh yeah so I'll probably see you guys tomorrow in the morning so I will see you guys then good morning ladies and gentlemen what do you know about that profitable Trader [ __ ] Market trade up there right now it's currently 9:30 in the morning last night you know it's kind of funny right because I don't know how this works or the science behind this and if you guys know let me know in the comments below but it's a little bit it's a it's a bit weird right so last night I Got 5 hours of sleep and it says I got 70% recovery but the majority of my sleep was what like 2 hours and 47 was restorative sleep right so then if I go to yesterday I slept 6 hours I took a nap and it savs 50% R so I slept almost 30% more and I got 30% less recovery right I come here to the next day well this day I really didn't sleep anything 4 hours but still that much then this next day look at this oh yeah 20% recovery so I slept 3 hours that night and then I took an hour and a half nap the day before slept 4 hours yeah so I don't really be sleeping at all if you guys can kind of notice this why I get so much [ __ ] done I'm literally up 90% of the day those you guys that sleep 90% of the day that's why you don't get nothing done but market update so let me show you guys where the market is so last night you guys can see that I was waiting for another confirmation rejection from this level to enter the trade that did not happen so we did not enter the trade even though we did get that it's just not what I wanted it's just not it's not it doesn't look like the right price action in order to enter the trade so we avoided another loss on this market now what I could be potentially looking for is going to be for Buys so if this daily Candlestick body closes above we're going to wait for a retest to then buy exactly how we did right here body close above retest and then buy but that can probably be something for next week because we're already on Wednesday uh so you know technically we only have about like a day and a half left Friday you don't want to take a trade on Friday so that's Euro AUD next is going to be USD CAD which we are still anticipating for this price to have a break and retest above currently just moving very very very slow looks like the market momentum is just slowing I mean look at look at look at this week's price action versus last week's like there's a big difference this is where you want to be trading this is where you don't want to be trading and last but not least it's going to be nzdusd so it looks like we are having some type of accumulation from this area I don't love the fact that we are having a ginormous daily bearish Candlestick pullback and we are can potentially close like that cuz that Candlestick only has 7 hours hours and I don't think within 7 hours we can completely retrace and reject this level so what I'm going to be waiting for is to see how the daily Candlestick closes so I can potentially enter this trade lendon session tonight if we keep accumulating like this I might be interested in taking this position I'm not super excited about it I'm just keeping my eye on it it looks like the only active position that the market is actually giving us so this is the only trade I'm actually looking to enter depending on how it rejects GBP CAD just waiting for the pullback GBP USD waiting for a deeper pullback so this is the the loss that we avoided earlier this week from here we had a ginormous push and we're waiting for a retest at this level to react but I actually wanted to retest this level before the other so yeah that's pretty much it um slow week so far and I told you guys this at the beginning I don't know if I told you guys here I did tell my students in the community though cuz I get live with them every single Sunday so I literally told them like look guys I don't want to say we got lucky but we timed the beginning of this challenge very well so I was telling the students that at the beginning of the week don't approach this week as if it were to be last week or the week before or the week before like we started the challenge at a week where the market momentum was moving so fast and it was giving so many so much volatility that it wasn't normal and you know you just simply look left you statistically look to the left and you can see that the moves that were happening in the last week or two haven't happened in 2 years so so keep that energy that hey just because it happened these last two weeks doesn't mean that it's going to happen next week you got to look at the trend this is uh I don't know Black Swan event right that's what they call it that this Market has moved this much in these two weeks and it's also a Black Swan event that we started the challenge on this week so it's a really good start to the challenge but it's not the realistic event of what the market is going to give us for the following week so kind of don't have that approach to these following weeks because the market does not have these type of moves every week now that's just a higher level of thinking a lot of new Traders won't understand that if you're a new Trader you just literally won't get it if you're an experienced Trader you'll get it you know that there's good weeks and you'll get it that there's bad weeks you just got to know when to be involved in the good weeks and when to avoid being involved in the bad weeks it's not about being involved every week it's about knowing when to be involved and when to not be involved and how do you know that by Simply Having experience and being here every single week so this week and last week I kind of explained a little bit of them like look I don't see the same Market moves that we've been having at the beginning of the challenge now so we should you know sit back a little bit and wait for those opportunities to come now we're going to [ __ ] lose so this week I don't think we're might enter a trade and if you know we do that'll be great if not we just wait until next week I've been 30 days in the past I've been a whole month like a month and a half almost without taking a position cuz there was just no opportunities I don't think that's going to happen now obviously but I don't know just going on a [ __ ] R right now well we'll check back in 9:30 in the morning we will check back in in couple hours all right so right now trade update it's 111 funny enough but there's these kids in the neighborhood that always pull up and it just like talk [ __ ] they're like fans but they're like really F last time they hustled me they sold me some candy some cheap ass old candy for like 100 bucks like I got robbed you know what I respect the hustle up okay you over they just met you a minute ago what's going on just so going on yeah this so who's this Charlie you guys want to see my cat fight it I saw it you want to see my cat fight it yes I want to see a fight you want to see a fight no no yeah bro it's it's three against one bro it's it yeah I'm not all right this see how she acts it's a go down oh no scared oh oh I didn't oh [Laughter] oh her nails are cut so don't worry oh Daniel oh yeah this is my office this is where I trade all right do any of you guys do any of you guys know how to trade trade no no do you guys know what trading is I know trading is all right somebody sit down who wants to be in the H you know my dog are you sure you want that spot yeah you sure saw the videos when you're like showing the trading all right is this going to go up or down it's going up it's going to go up raise your hand for up all right two raise your hand for now dude you haven't even looked at the charts all right so you think this is going to go down why what about this one do you think it's going to go up up or down right here so Price is Right Here Right Now do you think it's going to continue going up or do you think it's going to go down I think it's going to go down lowkey two for two you think this is going to go up or down clearly going up yeah that's going I think it's going to go up dude they're actually they're actually getting it bro that's actually kind of crazy you guys have not gotten one wrong huh yeah you have not got well all right like not like the whole move but like a piece of the move you guys haven't all right let's go boys I got to get back into some meetings got to get back to some work trade update it's currently like 5:00 no trades the right now going to play some basketball and hit the gym so better I'll make it backwards you didn't make it know oh it's crazy the community is in English Spanish all over the world it's crazy now I got to make this now I made it I know you actually did all right ladies and gentlemen market update it is currently 904 in the morning Thursday morning you know what I've realized this week has just consisted of dodging bullets like we've been off [ __ ] week like like literally like let me make sure this just not all week has consisted of dodging bullets now yes this is a real gun it's never been shot it's never been loaded don't worry for the people in the comments that are going to be sensitive I know how to handle some type of weapons so yeah I I I I've gotten trained on how to handle weapons I am very educated on weapons I respect weapons very dearly um I have many weapons so for those of you guys in the comments that are going to be sensitive don't worry I bit educated on but yeah this week has consisted of dodging bullets uh we have had some trades that we could have entered and uh obviously they were on the higher risk side of it currently right now you guys can see that the account is exactly the same we have not executed any trades so far which kind of annoying because we took stupid losses last week and now this week we the same losses we took last week that were counter Trend trades we could have taken them this week would have made us the money CU that's what the majority of this week has consisted of counter train trades and price having pullbacks but it's okay it is what it is lessons everything happens for a reason but it's just been dodging bullets we've just been missing all these different types of Trades so let me show you guys so to start off is going to be Euro no nzdusd so yesterday we anticipated for price to have a pullback and then obviously we're looking to enter at this area if you notice I've been calling all these pullbacks perfectly it's been getting right to the area it's been giving the engulfing which is the entry signal but then obviously you know we don't have the full shift the structure and everything we're looking for to enter the trade like we do have it here but I mean this happened at 5: in the morning dude I was knocked out at 5: in the morning so this is a trade that I would have possibly taken but again missed it because of the time zone I've been dodging bullets all week on this another pair is going to be Euro AUD so EUR AUD we were looking to enter the Cs here about a day or two ago and then we had the break then on this pullback we were looking for a buy now we broke under and then we're looking for the sell now we're breaking back above and now we could be looking for the buy it has just been an absolute [ __ ] show all right next is going to be USD CAD so USD CAD we had the pull back of this level of area of Interest the morning St formation rejection from this level and then again avoided that loss because we had the push to the downside no sh the structure but now we're under this air V just whenever we're under we're going down whenever we're under We're Going Down Under down under down under down so we can't buy if we are under looks like we're breaking above which is where we're going to be looking to enter this trade and after it breaks above which is this right here we're going to then have a retest so we avoided a loss here on this area avoided an unnecessary loss here if we were looking to sell simply because we were under it's just been I'm telling you I [ __ ] so those are the trades that we could be possibly taking now for sure GBP U is the be interested in next week this is not going to be ready for this week GBP CAD is going to be ready for next week as well we had the break but never had the retest Euro USD look at this just having a major pullback this [ __ ] like I don't even like I'm not even looking at Euro GBP is now finally having the pullback as well so I'd say the main focus could be gbpusd for a deeper retracement right around here to go long nzdusd possibly it'll retest to go short so we're going to going to remove this and remove this cuz we're no longer looking for that now we can do is look for a retest of this neckline of the headed shoulders retest of the round psychological level 60,000 retest of the EMA retest of previous structure level to then head to the downside so you guys are seeing how it looks good like that's why you have to find these killer support and resistance zones because whenever you're above it you're just ready to buy whenever you're under it you're just ready to sell that's I say that's why it's the second most important thing the first most important thing is Trend second most important thing is going to be the area of Interest so Euro or no nzd USD that's what I'm looking for Euro AUD is same thing you know we're going to be waiting for rejection from here this is probably the only trade that I could take maybe today depending how it closes um and then USD CAD we just got to wait for a retest so I put Euro AUD as number one ndd USD as number two GBP USD as number three so you guys are see oh exactly what I [ __ ] said look at this we remember that Channel that I drew out that I had to take out because it was pissing me off at the beginning of the week well look at that how about now H how about now you see this the same theory that I had we have this humongous Channel we then break out of it we retest it and then we head to the upside you look at it now here on gbpusd the ginormous Channel we break out of it we are now retesting it and then we're going to have the push to the upside wow said and forget once again giving you guys W that's crazy patience patience patience that is literally the key to this just waiting for all this to play out so today we have podcast um I'm going to go tour a penthouse I'm going to be getting a penthouse very soon here in Bickle brickl Miami um and then Sensei is going to go buy some cars we're just going to go with him I think my car is almost ready we might pull up and see it might give you guys a little sneak peek and then after that we are going to see where the day takes us so take a ride with us today on a little Vlog that we have cuz there's no trades that are going to be ready anytime soon from what I'm seeing here so it's a little Vlog day that we have to do today so podcast Penthouse tour and then new cars all right guys straight update as of right now still no trade in the account it's 11:30 in the morning gbpusd is having somewhat of the move so we can kind of see that it's having the rejection I did not expect that for it to happen right now which kind of sucks so we're going to see if we can possibly enter that later today maybe I don't like entering trade I mean the last thing that I like entering a trade is Thursday night so then Friday morning hopefully has a push and then we can just close right before Market Clos if I'm not in a good amount of profit and I don't want to hold for the following week so I don't know we'll see how it goes right now we're on our way to do a podcast with the students after the student podcast we're going to go eat currently on a fast and then after we eat we're going to go look at the new Penthouse that we might potentially add to the collection of [ __ ] that we have and the [ __ ] out the way dude oh by the way for those you guys that don't know the ferari has the craziest horn so does not beep here like the horn is literally like right here so so and then there's also one on this side right here so you have like both your thumbs so after we look at the penthouse we're going to then go watch s say buy new cars and we're going to go see if my new car is right so we'll update you guys as the day goes [Music] [Applause] yeah we are not we're not waiting that not happening this is how we do it I mean so the these are all NPCs right like look I I'll give you a perfect example right I guarantee you this next car it's just somebody automated that might be a cup this other in drive whatever this is right whatever this is it's just it's not a real person it's just a bot that they're just driving no they're just not driving anywhere you know like when you enter the lobby room in GTA and it's just cars driving going nowhere same thing these people just driving it's not real and it won't affect any of their Journey cuz they're not going anywhere like I can just cut look look I can just cut off this car right here nothing happens right

Canada he canceled the trip to go see his family in the Middle East to come see me instead of going to see his family which is [ __ ] crazy so we're going to actually bring him with us to go get the car the new car that I have just gotten and I'm telling you right now the new car that I have gotten is more expensive than this house that I'm in right now yesterday we took the previous student to go the podcast to go eat and then we went to go tour the penthouse with him now this student we're going to go pick up my new with oh [ __ ] I said the name well they blurred it out um so if you're not part of the Swing training lab student Community you're missing out so let me give you guys the recap for the week so as of right now we did not take absolutely any trades this week which kind of sucks because it somewhat sets us back a little bit from the momentum that we had going and there was great opportunities this week in the market but we just simply did not enter any of them and they were missed and we did avoid a lot of losses so let's get into it so to start off let's start off with Euro AUD so Euro AUD we originally started off the week interested on sells once price had retest this level avoided the losses then once price side to the upside we waited for a pullback to then buy avoided one of these losses as well and then we were looking to sell down here and then it decided to start having a push up so we avoided three losses on Euro AUD that we were interested in taking just by buying Above This support level and selling under this resistance level all right next is going to be nzdusd so earlier this week we anticipated price to have a push from this area to the upside we never had to pull back as deep as we wanted to so we missed that trade then when it pulled back we were anticipating to enter the buy here here if we would have entered this buy here it would have been something like this and we would have probably gotten stopped out so we avoided this loss but now it looks like the actual trade is having the momentum that it does for it to head to the upside which is good because this trade is going to probably be my number one pair for next week all I'm going to simply be waiting for for this pair for next week is going to be for a quick retest of this area right to then head to the upside so this is nzdusd next is GBP us D which once again we have this channel right here price broke out of the channel retested the level of resistance retested the level of support headed to the upside beautifully exactly how Euro USD did it we had the channel we broke out to the upside we then had the retest and then we took the trade to the upside so this trade was actually missed I should have [ __ ] taken this trade right here which would have been a beautiful let say I would have taken it somewhere in the middle of this Candlestick here so this high right right now it been easy a 1 to 2.5 ver to reward but it is what it is my anticipation is next week after this very strong weekly Candlestick it's going to have a pullback then the next week it's going to head to the upside and blah blah blah blah blah right so daily time frame it looks very very very clean we're going to leave this here because you know I do this like what what I'm giving you guys a quick recap right now is what I do every single Sunday with my students but in detail so I do the whole recap of what the week was like and then I anticipate the following week with the new trades that were interested in taking so gbpusd had the breakout had the retest is now heading to the upside I think it could come back retest and continue heading to the upside this Market structure is very very clean so this is another Market that we predicted but we missed and then this sell from right here we actually avoided that loss right at the beginning of the week next is USD CAD so USD CAD we were anticipating for price to have a rejection from here and head to the upside we avoided this loss because of this very strong bearish Candlestick if we would have obviously taken this trade right around here and now it looks like it's accumulating at this area where it could potentially head to the downside or if it breaks and retest it could head to the upside which is truthfully the ideal situation but for this one we're going to have to sit on our hands and see what the market is going to do GBP CAD price did have the break above how he wanted to never retested it and then your GBP is going going to be a trade that we're going to be interested in on this following next week so you guys got to tune in to next week to see exactly what this Market is going to do it's very easy right we have level support support support we broke it retested we're going to look to buy at this area it's pretty simple and then lastly Bitcoin right so I've never done Bitcoin here on YouTube I believe I strongly do believe that Bitcoin is going to have a rejection from this area head to around here you notice I have multiple different alarms notifying me of areas where I want to buy so I am not a BTC Trader I don't know how to trade BTC but I am looking to invest some funds into BTC and this is something that I literally do every single Sunday with my students it's part of the setup forget Community if you want to know more about it the link is in the description below but I literally share with my students the trades the Investments that I'm looking to do every single Sunday it's a live Zoom call you can literally ask questions directly to me of whatever Market is you want me to break down whatever questions you may have I answer every single week and I give you the top markets that I'm going to be trading for the week ahead on this exact challenge so if you literally copy the trades that I am sending out you're going to have the same results as mean the student from yesterday I was I'm copying the 100 to a mill challenge but I put in a grand in it instead I at like 30k I think right now that's crazy so that I thought I'll copy that and I thought if I can get that to a mill that would be insane you know what I mean that that's a massive Live account because I don't risk 1% for trade EV cuz I think it's [ __ ] he literally said he turned $11,000 to $330,000 following the same exact trades that he's been seeing on Sunday swings which is absolutely legendary and that's the fourth person that has done that so it's a four for four out of the four people have joined the podcast four of them are having the same results copying the same exact trades that they get on Sunday swings which is sick so if you want to know more about that the link is in the description below and yeah now Jay and juice is going to pull up in about a couple of hours and then after that we're going to bring him with us to go see the or you could blur it out you could yeah so we're going to we bought a [ __ ] now if you can guess the color of this if you can guess the interior if you can guess the what what else if you can guess the the mileage on this you win I know you win but you win so we're going to bring Jay and juice with us to go pick up because it is going to be a crazy experience for him and yesterday we took the student with us uh to go see the new Penthouse that we were looking to do and today you know what I like giving this experience to you guys out there because you guys trust in me and I'm like you know what let me just give you guys the access to this lifestyle that you guys can very easily obtain by simply showing up every single day so Jay and Juice literally did not go see his family to come see me so I'm going to make sure I made this experience worth it so just stay tuned for another day in the life with me all right so currently right now it is 3:54 in 3:50 in the afternoon so Jay and juice is literally about to pull up so he pulled up late he was psted up earlier for a podcast pulled up late so what we're going to do is we're going to go now to TPT pick up a watch and then we're going to go straight to go pick up the Bugatti so Jay and juice is a student from the 30-day boot camp and has had one of the craziest results anybody from the boot camp and we're about to meet him right now in person theice is balling out here huh look at this ain't know is real when your students P up on a crazy wh

I Turned $100 Into $22,696 in 6 Weeks Trading Forex
Aug 25, 2024

yo we just blew the whole [ __ ] account no that's how you closed the trade bro we literally just blew the whole account it's week six of me turning $100 into a million and let me tell you you guys aren't ready for this week and last week was honestly boring we traded a whole entire week and we did not take any trades where the account stayed at an $8,900 balance where we missed some opportunities but we actually avoided a lot losses this week has just consisted of dodging bullets we've been off [ __ ] week the goal for this week is to turn the $8,000 to $16,000 without using another tra so at the challenge it welcome to week six of me trainning $100 into million now this week is a little bit different now we got views of my [ __ ] Bugatti so if I don't complete this challenge I can't afford the Bugatti so I definitely have to complete the challenge and stay on Route so the go doesn't feel right right the Bugatti is pink I'm wearing blue I'll be right back give me a second more like it huh got to be on the same vibe as I cannot believe I [ __ ] did that dude still surreal what's the payment on one of those my payment is 46,000 a month and then the insurance is like 2500 so it comes out to like 48 49,000 every month so yeah we got a lot of work to do to make that up so let's start off the 100 to the mill challenge like always let's go straight into the myx book to show you guys where we are right now currently on the balance currently we have taken the 100 bucks to $88,000 you guys can see that the starting balance was 100 bucks and it was just updated 44 minutes ago down below over here you can currently see our win rate is currently a 70% of the total amount of Trades that we have taken taken a total seven amount of Trades and 100% of our trades have been short we have not taken any long positions and our average duration is an interesting 20 hours now this right here is going to be a problem very soon the commissions that we have on the account because the bigger obviously we start scaling on this challenge the more slippage the more commission everything that we're it's going to cost us to trade so I might be switching Brokers very very soon not entirely sure just yet but I will be letting you guys know if I do well I don't Market a broker I'm just going to let you guys know if I switch to a broker I don't plan to Market any broker anytime soon so with that being said let's go into the charts so currently right now let's start off with Euro GBP Euro GBP currently has a very clean weekly higher high structure move as you can see we were creating lower low lower high lower low and now we have a higher high where now we're having a higher low retracement to potentially have a retracement and rejection from this point right here when we go down to the Daily time frame you can clearly see that the daily time frame has had so whenever above this area you can see that price is having a reac reaction up and whenever we're above it we're having a reaction up and up whenever we are under we're having a push to then the downside so obviously now we are bullish and now we are above it what also coincidence that we have a round psychological level 85,000 along with the daily EMA so you have weekly area of interest you have daily area of interest you have round psychological level you have EMA strong level support and resistance it just simply makes more sense to buy this trade once it gets to this area rather than not so currently right now looks like we are having some type of a reaction from there looks like we are having a shift the structure and in the 1 hour we are having a potential inverted Head and Shoulders cuz obviously it's nowhere near being done what I want from this trade is for it to actually make it to this area of Interest I needed to actually hit it I need to actually for it to come here it did not get all the way there if you notice even when price is over here it made it just a little bit more just a little bit more so I'm going to need a for it to just make it just a little bit a little bit more down here in order for me to actually be interested in the trade but we'll see I don't know I might be interested in taking the trade now we'll keep you updated next GBP CHF probably one of the cleanest ones that you can probably see and it is this beautiful higher high higher low higher high higher low higher high higher low higher high boom Shi the structure lower low lower high lower low now this time frame is bearish now if I just show you guys this Market structure like this which is realistically how you have to look at the structure of the market not look at the market this right here is the structure of the market and you can clearly see how we were creating higher highs higher lows then we shifted we did a ginormous and beautifully formated double top pattern right here and now we're coming back to retest that neckline of the double top to then have a reaction to the downside what a coincidence that the neckline of the double top happens to also be at the weekly EMA and also happens to have a round psychological level one .1 to 500 which is obviously very key because now you just have three four things that simply make sense at this area in order for you to be interested in the trade what a coincidence now we also have the daily EMA we also have daily structure level so on and so forth so what I'm going to be waiting for for this trade is for price to have a break and retest under this little double top formation that we're potentially creating at this area here to have an alarm right at the bottom of it that's going to notify me as soon as we break out of it and this this trade once it does that it's going to have a great risk reward we can easily get a 1 to five or even to this structure point and then obviously we have a smaller stop loss we get like a 1 to six 1 to6 or. 7 this is a great risk reward on this trade because we are following the trend we're trading with the weekly time frame we're trading with the daily time frame and once that double top breaks we're going to be trading with the 4our time frame so we have three time frames that are going all in the same direction simply just enter the trade set and forget next is going to be Euro AUD Euro AUD was a little bit tricky last week and we avoided multiple losses on it now it looks like we are making our way down to this area of Interest where we will be interested in buying so we were looking for counter Trend trade shorts but they just simply did not play out obviously oh just to show you guys what time is it what time is it it's currently Monday so we start out the challenge on Monday it's currently 9:11 a.m. so on Sunday I kind of predicted that price was going to come back and then sell didn't do it so we're just going to wait for this trade at this area to then pretty much buy at this daily dma next is USD CAD USD CAD we currently had a very strong push the F the last two weeks that have pretty much engulf the last two weeks before that daily time frame we were rejecting under this area of Interest daily time frame went bearish rejection from the EMA just waiting for another lower high on this Market to take the trade to the downside so right now we are clearly at a lower low all I want is your price to have a lower high retest structure retest the EMA so then price can then head to the downside next is going to be gbpusd which I'm not entirely sure if this trade will even do this but would look fantastic if it does we had a very strong push last week breaking out of this channel now we have a higher low higher high I'm just anticipating for price to have a pullback retest support and resistance level so then head to the upside clearly this is a level very well respected resistance resistance and then resistance all the way over here so it's the same exact Zone we're just waiting for price to then retest it because we had the Breakout but we never came back and retested and what a coincidence if price starts to then come back and retest we're going to also retest this EMA along with this structure point so then just give it the new higher low to continue heading to the upside so what I do here is I simply just set my alarm at this area so I get notified once the trade reaches that point next is going to be nzdusd which truthfully I don't even like it I'll update you guys if I do later on throughout the week EUR USD and gvp CAD so the oh yeah GBP CAD is the last per that I'm currently interested in and I want you guys to to to to look at the market how I'm about to look at it right now if you're still paying very close attention to these analysis and not just looking at it as a NPC and looking at it briefly and just wanting to focus where is he going to enter where is he going to get out that's not how you're going to become successful that is not how you're going to make money and trading that is not how you're going to [ __ ] afford a Bugatti I'll tell you that for sure you have to look at the markets further than what it is doing right now like you have to have more of a deeper analysis and connection with the market that you just simply have to ask yourself does this make sense or no and you have to be realistic with that answer and 99% of you guys will not be asking yourself that question and for those of you that do whatever do you're not going to be realistic with that answer so you're never going to be successful in trading now I'm going to ask you two questions and you pause the video think about it and see what I say and see if it makes sense this market right here all right cool the does it look bullish right higher high higher low higher high higher low what do you think the answer is probably yes okay so you would be looking to buy this Market essentially right the answer is probably yes all right well let's just look a little bit to the left real quick and let's see what the market has done last time it was at this high so if I look over here price has not been to a high like this one since this structure Point here when I check the date down here on the structure Point March 20 21 so it has not been here in about three years almost four years all right cool let's keep going to the left when was the last time the structure actually made it this far okay this point right here when was that March 2019 okay cool cool cool let's keep going when did it actually break out of it actually broke out of it here when was that February 18 2018 so a little bit over 7 years ago so why would you buy a Market that has not broken through a strong level of resistance that has been struggling to break through it for many many many many years to come and the one time that it did break it it just completely changed the trend all the way down does it make sense to buy here probably not cuz last time it literally made it right up to that high and the structure made it right to 177 500 it did not have the break through it it had a major reaction from it and I'm just literally looking at this part right here and if I move it this way it looks just like this and what happened here it went down if I take this and I go over here it looks the same and what did it do it went down so yes even though the trend might be bullish you have to be very observative to what price has done to the left because what happens to the left is going to repeat itself so not saying Longs aren't the best thing but I wouldn't say it would be something I would be fully focused on due to the fact that we have not been able to break through this resistance level here and you're basically buying right into the highest level of resistance that the market has been rejecting from So currently right now might be interested in some some counter Trend trades to the downside maybe once we break under this level I'm going to be very observative with this one right I'm going to be very selective because I do like this I do like this Shi D structure that's currently happening right now I definitely see this as a upwards Channel again I hate using trend lines but I just like the channel That it forms so maybe if we have a break out of that channel retest it I'll be probably interested in sales so that's pretty much it for right now currently market update 9:25 in the morning so I think our goal this week is uh to see me drift the Bugatti I want to drift the Bugatti I don't think anybody's ever done it and I'm going to do my best to make sure that goes down safely in a controlled environment you know what I'm saying so stay tuned and we'll update you guys in a bit all right so Jordan just pulled up right now so Jordan can't even [ __ ] walk cuz obviously he's still recuperating from cancer and he just pulled up right now driving with like this hand stick thing that he's doing bro he that looks like a [ __ ] gun that looks like a gun sh I don't get shot if I get P yo for real is it stuck to the pedal yeah stuck to the pedal only is like it has this little play it's weird bro it feels weird it feels weird yeah you feel weird you want to in the Bugatti yeah I'm down but you have to like literally like it's a mission you have to like pick me up I'll pick you up and like literally like carry me Dr me down Bro you've done more missions than them you're [Music] [Music] I was it dog yeah yeah that sh crazy this thing is literally the fastest thing I've been in they want to have your the Bugatti um in this warehouse and have this marching trumps marching band behind it playing while Kodak and all them are rapping in front but Trump will not be there I I mean I've been part of a couple music videos I know how this [ __ ] goes you know yeah yeah start pull up at 3: start at 7 end at 1: in the morning you know bro I [ __ ] hope it's not like that I will see you down there sick all right I'll see you at that address tomorrow okay thank we were supposed to meet Trump tomorrow but we're going to be Kodak Black and 42 Doug it's pretty sick you know you know what's funny I was actually going to give Kodak Black a cyber truck at the beginning of the year but I just couldn't make the connection and stuff but it's crazy how things turn around now I'm going to meet Kodak Black and my Bugatti is going to be in the music video with Trump which is kind of [ __ ] sick if you ask me so trade up dat you know what a trade up dat right bro I just laugh because it's like I was just a kid from Dunkin Donuts dude just literally working a regular N I wasn't even working a 9 to 5 I was working a 7 to 3 I was I was being there at 700 in the morning leaving at 3:00 to now literally being one step away one phone call away from the president of the United States of America I think it's insane gives me goosebumps it's it's it's almost surreal how this has become the new normal in my life but I'm very grateful because all this was because of trading because trading would have trading built the character and the person that I am today and without trading being in my life none of this would have ever been possible so if you're going out there through a journey and it's just difficult and you're in that lonely Journey losing losing losing and having thoughts of giving up trust me don't do it there is light at the end of the tunnel and it will all be worth it trust me trust me so trade update currently right now it is 9:00 at night so I think it's about 12 hours since the last time we did the last update as you can see I'm wearing the same clothes I have not left the house all day literally been here chilling still no trade in the account as we speak but we might enter a trade right now on this GBP CHF So currently daily time frame close very very very clean double daily rejection from this area of Interest I would have loved it would have made it a little bit higher but I love how the 4 Hour right now is potentially about to break on the the structure level which is going to give us the 1 hour head and shoulders and then basically we're going to have the retest of this neckline right here as soon as we do that so it's going to be a quick break retest and then we enter this trade potentially right so I might enter this trade as soon as it breaks out through here I don't know figure it out next is Euro GBP so we want to enter this trade as soon as it has the retest of this level to head to the upside we have not quite made it there just yet the 4H hour is Shifting and I do like this it looks very clean so if we have a nice higher low shift the structure here then I would enter the trade so I'm going to wait for a little bit of a pullback to enter this trade to the upside um GBP CHF is the one that we just analyzed Euro a D not interested USD CAD not interested GBP USD is the only other one that I'm interested in which obviously we're at the higher high still waiting for that pullback and then lastly is GBP CAD so we are rejecting that high time frame rejecting that round psychological level almost and then the 4-Hour time frame is slowing down on this pullback so I might be interested in entering a counter Trend trade if we do something like this but remember every single time I take a counter Trend trade I'm breaking my [ __ ] trading plan you know that means I got to drive the [ __ ] Punisher you [ __ ] Beetle you you know what it is that owning a Bugatti probably the most expensive car you could buy I have access to and you being so true to your word that if I don't do what I'm supposed to do I'm going to punish myself and not drive my $3 million Bugatti and I'm going to drive my piece of [ __ ] Beetle that guy I have a man at my [ __ ] word and I'll show you guys so now we got Jane juice pulling up for the podcast but right before for the podcast we got to drop off the Bugatti you know what I'm saying we're going to put some little set and forget stickers on this video video we know you got to remember marketing marketing is key got to spread the brand of the number one trading strategy in the world Nam set of forget so we're going to put C forget stickers all over the Bugatti for the music video tomorrow so let's go all right we got J and Juice in the house run of a pod right now's going on brother he was waiting on us for us to do the Pod so we're going to go real quick to drop off the Bugatti to do some stickers and then we'll run up the BT you haven't been in the Bugatti here right no not yet yeah he was actually the first person to actually see and he hasn't r in it yet so we're going to take him for a ride see his see his reaction he's he's not ready I already put 250 Mi on it driving it what do you feel like bro honestly now I don't know if this is going to about I don't know if this is about to sound [ __ ] up or not dude but I feel normal right now yeah then if it's a really good thing then what comes after like you know let's say I normalize this so much that's what I wanted like after the pot I want remember like the cigar I was like I I was thinking like we light up a cigar and I want to talk to you about this [ __ ] cuz if you got a Bugatti now like next bro like I hate to break it to you but next it's it's a private jet probably like that that's it like that's the thing and you just have to accept it and now it's the normal so remember what I was telling you yesterday all right you ready hey hey yo bro yo I'm numb brother I don't feel anything n that's crazy no literally it was it was spinning so it wasn't like it was it wasn't grabbing yeah but like you hear the turbo and stuff BR and the downshift yeah transmission's mad aggressive too boy what's going oning the dude you're [ __ ] skinny dude you look great bro you too y yeah dude what the [ __ ] how does it look how does it look look sick it looks straight out of a movie it doesn't look real bro so I think I think I think we should put like set and forget [ __ ] right here I think we should only do it on this side honestly look cuz if you put it that way I feel like it's going to look rer look so then I think I think we should put set forget down here no yeah I generally think that you're not you're not ready no you're not ready really going next get 100 bucks per ride 100 bucks per ride yeah so today's not Tom Price to me real quick pass it to me I was going to just give it right back to him and be like here's your 100 yo what the actual [ __ ] Alex yo Slow Down slow down what the [ __ ] yo bro I told you bro it's literally dude this is the craziest car ever this is insane this is my first time in a Bugatti I learn from my stop losses not from my take profits if something hits a take profit that's super normal to me I really continue with my day like that was what supposed to happen if it hits my stop plus I'm surprised like because I'm really really selective with every single trade I take and I'm not not in the market because I can't can't wait to make more money for brother that's that forget Bo that forget all right guys today might be getting gooseb today might be the [ __ ] day we take a trade and we actually win we haven't taken a trade and one since our friend right here has been here you know I cannot make this [ __ ] up yo isn't that crazy he's back we're taking a trade right now we're taking a trade right now Mark market update Mark I what the hell is going on I can't believe this thean is back yo isn't that crazy that's your friend all right so market update right now market update it is currently 9:28 in the morning we have not taken any positions the account is still exactly the same $894,000 sign right there my boy okay so let's start off with Euro GBP so yesterday on Euro GBP we were up here at this high and anticipated for price to have that pullback in order for us to actually start heading to the upside so we're having that pullback and honestly I don't even think I need an entry signal I just think I need the Iguana signal I I'll take a trade right now on I bet guess what if I did do that I would then have to drive the beetle remember if I break my trading rules I have to drive the Beetle and I don't want to drive the beetle in the heat here in Miami I don't want to be sweaty I have a Bugatti I want to drive my Bugatti chilling so this is Euro gvp which right now we are currently waiting for this 4our time frame to potentially close as and go from Candlestick or you know what we can actually take this trade once it body closes above this structure point right here once it does do that if it does do that we can have a very a very very very comfortable stop loss of about 30 Pips under the area of interest and then we could have our take profit anywhere up here and this can be a solid 1 to 2.7 risk of reward maybe I can minimize the stop loss a little bit more and then obviously a risk to reward would be a lot greater but I am actively looking to enter this trade I'm going to put an alarm right up here uh GBP CHF last night it did not have the body CES the closure under the structure level how we wanted it to uh we did hit the alarm probably like at 1: 2 3 in the morning I was knocked out I literally did not even like like hear or notice anything any of this I am still very much interested in taking this position so I'm going to literally set a new alarm right down here refresh it because this thing kind of glitches out sometimes so we're going to set an alarm right at the bottom of this level right here which is going to be as soon as it breaks into that structure but truthfully I feel like I might just enter this trade probably right now because it did have the shift of structure it did have the potential Head and Shoulders that it's creating right now oh man dude this is not the time for this this is not the time to not be moving fast come on so this is the left the head and then the right shoulder we did break under that structure point this is the engulfing Candlestick right here this is not a bad entry up here but you know what I want something right around here I need that extra confirmation in order to enter that trade so as soon as price kind of gets to this area right here we're going to actually enter the trade I'm going to even add another alarm just so I get double alarm and literally that's all we need I don't really need to enter any other market like obviously you know we'll look at these markets just to educational purposes Euro AUD we never broke and retested above never took a trade but the move actually did end up happening USD CAD never retested to them but the move did end up happening gbpusd never had the pullback but the push ended up happening nzdusd we were interested never retested the move ended up happening gvp CAD this one did not do anything that we we wanted to this actually going to be a very good trade to take once it rejects up here from this level EUR USD same thing and then we're not interested in this market Yeah so basically EUR GBP we're looking to enter and GBP CHF we're looking to enter and if we go short on GBP CHF literally if we're selling it that means that the pound is getting weak and if we are buying Euro GBP that means that the pound is getting weak so they're both cross-correlated perfect cuz if we were to be selling both if this Market sells then that means that the pound is getting strong because euro is the base and the GBP is the quote but since they're both basically doing the opposite which is how it's supposed to be that kind of confirms that this can now potentially get strong right now and that this can get strong right now as well so stay tuned for market update leave no they still there still there oh [ __ ] don't don't move hey don't scare okay uh we might take this trade right now just because of the uana and we're going to get ready for a long day today we got to go see Kodak Black what should I feel like we got to gift him something feel like we got to gift Kodak something like I've been listening to Kodak since I was like 15 Bo I'm about my squir you know I've been listening to Kodak since I didn't even have a car and I was jamming him out now the fact that I'm going to put my Bugatti in one of his music videos with Donald Trump it's just it just doesn't it doesn't feel real you know it just it's insane to me I was going to high school listening to the song like yo Florida boy I like this guy it's cool and obviously he blew up I was listening to Kodak when he was not big at all I was just believing in him you know I'm like supporting him and then he took off and now it's kind of weird how the whole thing reconnects I don't know it's I I I I wouldn't know how to explain what's about to happen right now so it's about to be a very long day all I can say is let him forget patience P well obviously we just patience P my boys it's all thanks to you when you when you catch a trade like the one that I'm in right now who the [ __ ] is call oh this is the Trump thing so uh quick update we we had a move the shoot to tomorrow morning um it's 100% tomorrow morning I'm not sure if that's still going to work with you guys and sorry for the last minute change we're just been coordinating with all the artists and everything trade update we are in GB EF as you guys can see we're currently up about $6,000 so we entered this trade earlier literally probably like [ __ ] I don't know like an hour ago but we're in the middle of all these cause and the trade is now heading into our Direction everything's looking very well we're actually in a lot more profit than I expected obviously I did not account how volatile this pair is I did not realize that if this pair goes into a little bit more draw down we'll blow this account completely cuz this pair is super volatile I actually have not entered a trade in GP CHF in a very long time but this trade right here if it does does hit my takeprofit it could take this account up to like $70,000 if it does make it all the way down here so we're in our trade Euro GBP which is the other position currently is actually having the push as well but I likeed GBP CHF better so with that being said set and forget so no video shoot with Kodak Black today you guys can see this is how it is with these celebrities bro it's always they're always changing times always changing dates it's part of the pro So today we're probably just going to now change our whole entire schedule hit the gym and see where the day takes us so stay tuned when are we going to you know drift the Bugatti yeah so we got to go drift the Bugatti dude but I want to drift it when it's raining cuz it's like I don't it's a Bugatti you know what I'm saying I'm a Savage I don't care I'll do whatever but I got to be a little bit more intelligent and mature about this decision it's it's going to get done but it's going to be done calculated everything we do is very calculated and structured and I don't want to just do it crazy cuz it's like dude an ax on a Bugatti is probably like $150,000 that's fine no big deal problem is the time down it'll be down for like 3 months waiting for that part to come in and all that stuff so we'll update you guys all right trade update trade update still in the same spot we have not moved at all account is literally exactly the same actually never mind we are actually up about $7,000 nap time I'm honestly concerned with that face it's a good face cuz the Iguana was here oh [ __ ] it left I don't know if we should close the position now cuz we're up $177,000 on this trade let's [ __ ] go literally pass the take profit that we had for the week the week goal that we had was make 16,000 balance balance we're currently $26,000 in profit and truthfully we were actually up more we're probably around like: 30 but it's 5:00 right now as you can see right here 5:00 5:00 p.m. EST and the spread at this time is insane so let me show you guys literally from exactly where we entered the trade little to no draw down straight right into profit daily time frame has closed absolutely beautifully engulfing and now we are simply going to expect for price to have a little pullback and then continue heading to the downside all we're going to do is simply set and forget now next trade is Euro gvp which it also had the move exactly as we've been anticipating we didn't actually enter this trade we were just watching it but it is playing out so this trade is looking very solid um I could expect the 4H hour to come back retest this neckline here before actually heading back to the downside so we have to be on the lookout for that pullback so for now nothing else that we can do other than just what should we do now I think let's go hit the city let's go have a quick lunch at the city maybe gym and see where the trade goes okay but when are we drifting the Bugatti we're going to drift it when it's raining trust me when it starts raining we're going to drift it I promise I keep my word with everything remember it just it hasn't rained look at the weather it looks like it's going to rain but it hasn't let's go hit the city let's go flex a little [Music] bit ladies and gentlemen we are finally back home long long day in the city uh we might move to the city soon I might be a city boy very soon but not confirmed just yet currently 11:20 at night market update the account is currently sitting at drum roll please $38,000 Ching well right now I think this trade is that's why I'm not even that excited because I do think this trade right now in London session is going to have a pullback let me show you so I think now this is will have a retracement to retest this neckline of the left head right shoulder for then the trade to then head to the downside currently on the daily time frame we Clos very strong as a bearish engulfing but we could come back and retest these daily Wicks right here so then the trade can continue heading to the downside now this is where a lot of beginner Traders will probably get you know fomo and you their close out their positions here or they can probably set and forget the whole entire way currently just waiting for it to do its thing Euro gvp had its pushup once again I think it could have another type of quick pullback before actually having the push to the upside GBP CHF is the one where we're actually in and if it does have a pullback once it is in here I'm going to be determining whether I you know cut my loss a little bit short or I set them forget because if that trade goes a little bit into draw down we will blow the account and we're going to have to start all over I am not trying to start all over so I'm going to make sure that I can do this appropriately So currently right now 11:20 at night we're going to now probably go take a shower and just look at the charge through the phones throughout the whole entire night and see what happens tomorrow in the morning so we'll update you guys in the morning all right guys good morning trade update it is currently 9:16 and in the morning kind of stayed up last night to like 2: 3 in the morning pretty much for no reason exactly what I explained that was going to happen happened we are currently back up to drum roll please $32,000 and profit how much were we up yesterday about the same right yeah about the same not exciting on all but technicals are exciting so yesterday if you noticed we were down here at this Candlestick and I explained that we had to have this retracement in order for price to continue heading to the downside exactly what we did now we're having that retracement to now potentially continue heading to the downside now this is key to understanding that this draw down or Draw down or losing some profits had to happen in order for this trade to now create that new lower leg push this might sound crazy but I would actually would have liked if it came up a lot further because then I confirmed that it would reject this neckline of this head and shoulders of support support support then use as resistance and then if it has the push now I somewhat know that it would never come back up there so now that it didn't make it there there's a little Gap and they can potentially fill that Gap so that is a little bit of a red flag but we'll be fine next is Euro GBP same exact thing it's having the pullback just how I explained now we should have a reaction from this point now before actually heading to the upside so basically the only trade that we're in right now is and interested in is GBP CHF and we're just expecting for this to continue heading to the downside so there's not much else to do other than S and forget so today is day day two trying to pull up to this music video with Trump and Kodak and oh and now they're going to add AB Antonio Brown um into the mix crazy right I I don't I don't ask questions problem the problem with all these celebrities is that they're not organized they're just all over the place very normal in the industry and they're just Changing Times moving locations and I'm just kind of on standby which is kind of annoying because I got a bunch of [ __ ] to do and I'm kind of just moving things around to make this happen so we'll update you if we actually end up doing it but now they changed from yesterday to today in the morning and now last night they sent a message hey we're going to change the time from the morning to another time that we'll update in the morning like all right all right I'm okay so right now currently up 32,000 I think it went a little lower sad I forget so you're telling me you're going to turn $100 into a [Music] million no [ __ ] way no wig so you're taller than LeBron I'm like 6'2 How much taller are you than him I don't know maybe we're using different metrics I copy trade you but instead 10x that and I put in $1,000 I'll make $10 million I'll put you dude some guy started with 5K and he's already up 158 and I'm only up at I'm at 22,000 look my trade I just literally at 22,000 this is not going in the commercial for whatever this is I don't want to be no look prove this guy wrong look so I started off with 100 bucks okay and I scaled scaled scaled and I'm at 22,000 right now okay but there I saw some red in yeah I took losses of course yeah I loss is part of the game I took two losses my wins that away my loss you have you have to take this is a big comeback right here yeah that's two negative days but then a big swing back on six you were were you sweating right there little bit Yeah so wait if you fail start again I failed it's be like but if you fail that means everyone else with you failed that's part of the game bro but that's so much I know it's a lot of but you're only starting with 100 bucks you are well whoever if people want to start with more that's not my problem yeah that's fair like that's just crazy pressure cuz if you think about you're not trading for only yourself all your guys are trading for yeah like all of my videos right now and literally like by the end of the week they all have 150,000 views by the end of the [Music] week this wouldn't be suspicious if it wasn't a Bugatti look I got some cash for you bro that's a bit extra but so I have 500 and hundreds and I got 10 one you can do whatever you want with this there's a there's a place I know you could go yeah you got a boy trap right here on the comment say I know Alex They Know You by name thank you very much good morning ladies and gentlemen yesterday I don't know if you can tell about my face was a very long [ __ ] day biggest waste of time ever nobody showed up you know what I am literally not surprised that is how [ __ ] goes when you go do events with people like this now today they're calling me yo pull up please pull up you got another today they're going to actually show up I'm like dude I'm not I don't think I'm going to go I don't think I'm going to go key word cuz a picture with Trump and Kodak like you just don't get that ever again you know so Cent ly we have hit the goal for the week turning $100 into a million where we are now currently at a $222,000 balance now remember we started off the week wanting to take $8,000 up to $116,000 now I'm not as excited because I saw $35,000 on the balance at one point now I the reason why I closed the position and I didn't set and forget is simply because yesterday and of the commotion we were supposed to like not have our our phones and I didn't want to not be able to look at it so as this trade was pulling back up into this area I saw potential for this to actually have a push up through here and actually make it through this daily area of interest and then make it back up to retest this level of Support over here and this level of resistance to actually retest round psychological level 1.1 2500 as you can see it looks like the daily has created a higher low higher high looks like it's creating a higher low right now retesting that structure and it could be the push to actually make it up into this area to then have the push because technically it hasn't quite made it there just yet so for now kind of sucks because I do want to be in this position and truthfully entering this position now it's literally not that far from our original entry it's literally just 13 Pips so I'm going to definitely be on the lookout to enter this position again I was just kind of confused thinking that you know what if we're not going to have our phones they got to move us everywhere and I got to do something here I got to just make sure I I I could lock in my stuff know the president's pulling up to some place trust me it's Secret Service not [ __ ] around so Euro GBP though we completely avoided this loss right here this loss was completely avoided on the initial push on the pullback just a loss avoided as a whole and it's kind of it's quite interesting because this is actually one of the top trades that I had set for myself up for this week weekly time frame looks reasonable looks like it could actually make it all the way back to that structure point so this will be a pair that we'll be interested in for next week this never happened oh you know what I'll do another video on Instagram now to show people and educate people on why we avoided this loss Euro Au currently having that pullback that we were anticipating after having a reaction from the structure level not interested in it GBP CAD just continuing having the push to the upside USD CAD just continuing having the push to the downside gbpusd continuing to have the push to the upside which is insane nzdusd had the push never stopped and then Euro USD just continued to have the push to the upside so literally the only pair that is still somewhat looking good is GBP CHF and I'm going to be waiting for a new added entry position on this sometime very very very very soon so not super stoked because we actually had more money into the accounts and because I am tired dude we've been like I think for the last 2 weeks every single day except Saturday or Sunday we've been sleeping 2 three hours every single day and that [ __ ] just builds up you know so I don't know I S for good all right so in a day like today not such a sunny great day got to make the most out of it so body owner like myself take an opport like this to potentially see if it could drift I went on YouTube I searched up how to drift the B nothing came up no way in their life and tri to the guy especially the pink guy but you know what you got to be your first some somebody's got to do [Music] [Music] we [ __ ] did it yo we just blew the whole [ __ ] account no that's how you closed the trade bro it literally just blew the whole account F we just withdrew all the money so we just draw the money from the current broker should get into my wallet by the end of today maybe tomorrow and uh we're going to deposit into a new broker which I might be letting you guys soon which broker it's going to be so you guys are going to have the same market conditions as me current broker right now the fees were all over the price the commissions were okay it was more of the slippage I would literally try and close a trade out I get slipped out I wouldn't get close at the point that I wanted to so I'm going to be switching to a new broker today pretty much and uh we'll see where the challenge goes from that point sucks that we're not in this position anymore so gbpchf is still exactly in the same spot I could anticipate maybe a little bit of another Pool back here before heading up to the downside tonight so let's see if the deposit hits by today so that I can enter this position London session tonight so I will update you guys then see you guys we're [ __ ] back I can't even explain why we're [ __ ] back here goes uh so we just got here at 10 kodak's not here yet we'll probably be here in like 30 minutes we going to leave to like 3 in the [Music] morning on this side right quick my bad wait hold on hold on hold on hold I'm not going to lie this [ __ ] feels a little too wobbly [Music] we are still here 9 a.m. basically a trade update and we're still here well after a couple hours finally got it up now we got to take it from this P truck to that to Tru [ __ ] this D this is real life man [ __ ] can I give you the bird yeah oh we're just show should we show them doesn't matter I guess you show them it doesn't matter right well this is all I'm going to show right here the beginning of this video start off with my new Bugatti now you may ask yourself this guy can't buy any more cars he has 10 11 cars how can you buy another car well I did I bought another car and I'm going tell you right now I just upped the Bugatti in rareness right not so much price for me to up the Bugatti I'd have to sell my cat and I have to I'd have to sell you I'd have to sell everything all right cuz uping up the Bugatti is $6 million right it's it's uh you know I could do it but I'm going be eating Ramen no for the rest of my life no it just won't be a smart financial decision but I did buy a new car and all I can say is I wish show you guys next week so with that being said let me show you guys how this week has ended exactly what I said exactly what I said market update GBP CHF we Clos out the trade around this level around here simply because I strongly predicted that price is going to have a pullback and retest this level and that the weekly time frame was not done having the pullback can expect for price to have a push up into this area and and then as soon as you get there then have the rejection price has to stop for about a week how it did here price pushed stopped and then the next week it had the push same exact thing here price had the push stop retracement so on and so forth price has the push stop then push price has the push stop then push that's what we are anticipating for this week to come ahead so we avoided not making any money this week simply because we have experience in the market you can have the best trading strategy which is simply mine set and forget I'm done throwing you know little shots that make it it's the best it's just the reality situation not up for discussion anymore ICT SCM MCC all you ICT and MC Traders while you guys watching this video right now ICT so good and and smart money whatever is so good H well no comment no so had to get that out here I feel so good getting out that my chest cuz all the icts are the best what are you guys doing here huh exactly gotcha so s foret is number one no longer out for discussion even you having the best strategy you need to have time and experience to truly know what is going to happen next in the market because you are in sync with the market you just understand it like I've seen this pattern happen so many times in the market structure yes you can have the Hoin St strategy checklist everything makes sense to 100% but then you just looking at it it doesn't look right it just doesn't look like it's ready for the move it needs that next step and the only way you can actually determine that is by experience and that's exactly what we just showed you guys here how experience led me to closing out the trade at the perfect point before it went into my stop-loss area so yeah this week we are already going to deposit the new $22,000 in into the account for next week so you guys can see the $22,000 have been retrieved from the account so we're going to deposit into a new broker test it out if we like it I'm going to be sharing the broker with you guys so you guys can simply use it and every single one of these trades I want you guys to have this extremely clear I share with my students every single week on Sunday swings I get on a call with them I give them my top two top three pairs that I'm going to be trading for the week ahead I literally give you guys trading signals but it's a lot better than a signals because a signal you just get a text message enter

explaining to you my whole thought process behind the trade if I just send you a signal there's no thought process you just kind of have to figure it out I'm giving you a full-blown one twoh hour call

I Tried to Turn $100 Into $40,000 in 49 Days Trading Forex
Sep 1, 2024

it's week seven of me turning this $100 into a million now last week was a little bit crazy because I actually turned $8,000 into $22,000 but now the goal for this week is to actually turn these same $22,000 into $44,000 so with that being said let the challenge begin well it's Sunday right now so this would be tomorrow for me for you guys it' probably be in 2 seconds good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to week number seven turning $100 into a million so this week's goal is to turn the $22,000 into $44,000 and you know what you want to know what's crazy like as I keep getting closer to this million right you know as I'm growing the account people are constantly like getting closer to me because they want to be part of now the big numbers nobody want to be part of turning the 100 bucks to 200 200 to 400 cuz boring right it's just super boring but now I'm about to turn this 22 to about 30 40,000 and look what look what shows up here huh I'm going to copy the traits so this guy doesn't know how to trade right he's like learning how to trade now so I got to teach him and he wants to look look at this wallpaper fun number one that's how you know it's real so even it be your own people as you start getting up they just they only come when they need something remember that it be your own so come here come here this what I sh come here bring me the chair get the chair all right so okay all right so this is week number seven turning $100 into a minute so this is what we do here right we do trade update what time is it 11:19 11:19 starting balance is $22,000 right so now this week we have four solid Market opportunities all right the first one is going to be gbpn DD right now where we currently have a very very strong level of support we have resistance support level all throughout here and currently we have a potential left head right shoulder obviously if we were to break through that neckline but this Market structure is bullish it went bearish higher low higher high lower low lower and then it went bearish here then after as soon as it Clos above this structure it went bullish and now we're back at this strong support level if you look at it on the weekly time frame it looks absolutely beautiful it is retesting these w in the structure weekly had a strong higher high now having high higher low and we're at the round psychological level one well 2.200 or smart money concept right smart money concept smart money concept smart money concept or the blocks or the blocks that he's a smart money concentrator and look where he is you know that speaks for itself um so so daily time frame we are bullish and we are rejecting off of the support level so I'm looking for a little pullback to buy but if we do body close under I'm going to then continue to wait for the retest to then sell once we have the head and shoulders pattern cuz then the 4H hour will also be bearish as right now we've had a reaction from this point waiting for a little pullback to have a reaction then they take this trade to the upside next is going to be nzd JPY we currently have three very strong weeks of a push now measure the most recent three 3 weeks of a pullback the same 3 weeks don't even make up for 35% of the previous 3 weeks push which shows you that clearly the sellers are in the market and buyers are nowhere near stronger than the sellers so this is a good indication to look to continue to sell the last 3 weeks can even engulf the last one week and coincidentally enough we are also at this structure level and support and resistance level then on the daily time frame obviously you can see major sellers and look how hard the daily time frame buyers are struggling at this level of support and resistance as you can see left is a veryable level of supports and resistance all throughout here so I hate using trend lines once again I hate using these channels but it does look clean so we have this upwards channel that the market is currently moving in that it's just a visual representation to show you that the market is having a bullish pullback for us to enter this trade we have to wait for the break and retest to pretty much go on the cells it's going to be a very clean sale on this market right here next is going to be nzd C so again this is a very valuable lesson and learn this lesson because this cost me about a year and a half of just losses to kind of figure out how to get to this point where I am now where I'm avoiding these losses all the time so let me show you so if you were to look at this trade just in the 4 Hour you can see that the 4 Hour is very bullish you would see resistance break retest you would be obviously in interested in buying if you to look at basic Market structure level here you're going to look at something like this and this right here is pretty clear indication to buy there's no way you're going to sell right into this support level but the mistake that Traders are doing is that they're not taking account the higher time frames if you look at the daily yes daily looks absolutely beautiful retesting structure retesting structure retesting structure to then head to the upside but we are clearly not rejecting that point right now why that is because the weekly time frame is at a higher high notice how this was creating lower low lower high now we are bullish with a higher high so you're essentially buying this Market at this point right here on the weekly time frame you're buying at pretty much the higher high which is what you don't want to do the weekly time frame can easily have a deeper retracement to head to the upside you're only focusing on this right here when you go to the 4 Hour and you're not take in account this whole move that the weekly time frame has done to just create that minor pullback so I would consider this on the 4H hour a fake out to just get some stop losses then this will shift bearish so then the weekly time frame has a deeper pullback there's a very higher level way of looking at the markets but once you get it it'll make a lot a lot a lot of sense next GBP JPY currently same exact thing as nzd JPY we've had three very strong weeks of sells three very soft weeks of pullbacks and then on the daily time frame we are currently creating what looks to be a double top formation we're going to Simply wait for price to break and retest out of that neckline of the double top and then in the 4H hour it'll be a breaking retest out of this consolidation Zone that we currently have right now this is very easy very textbook I'm simply trading with the trend there's nothing else that I'm Reinventing the wheel here next AUD JPY pretty much just the same thing break and retest out of this consolidation Zone we've had three very strong weeks of sells three very slow weeks of a pullback retesting structure and you may ask why are you taking the same trade of that kind of look the same they're all JPY and the point is one of like one of them is going to give the cleanest entry they're all going to have the move cuz they're all correlated the same or have a very similar move cuz they're all correlated the same because of the JPY so what I do is that I put all of these different markets together and I simply take whichever one looks the cleanest I'm not stuck or biased on GJ or I'm not stuck or biased on AUD or ND I don't really give a [ __ ] I actually don't care at all I care to take which one makes the most sense and which one is the cleanest so I'll put all four of them on my watch list and they're all going to probably four have the same move because they literally just did the same move for the last 2 months having the push and the pullback so I'm going to wait for now to see which one has the cleanest move so a JPY is literally pretty much the same thing then GBP CHF is the one where it's a bit interesting which is where he took it last week so this one we have a retest of this level of support and resistance hasn't quite made it just yet but it can definitely still daily time frame we are kind of creating what the double top of GBP JPY kind of looks like looks very similar at this neckline point right here so I'm going to simply be waiting for a surprise to just confirm to me that we're breaking out of this area then I'll enter on the pull back to then sell and uh that's pretty much it Euro GBP it won't be ready this week and then Euro AUD won't be ready this week at all now I got to teach my new student how to trade did you pay me already or no let's see yeah he's not he doesn't he [Music] doesn't all right trade update decided to come on the boat look look what a look a beautiful day it is right you have people jet skis but right now my boat R out of gas

but the guy doesn't doesn't own that you going ready I do it one 2 [Music] 3 all right this one to get the [Music] we in the middle of a [ __ ] hurri right now h y set [ __ ] for [Music] good morning ladies and gentlemen well technically good afternoon it is currently 12: in the afternoon right now yesterday we got home from the boat super late took two trades last night late into London session um not not this kind of trade so no we didn't we didn't take this trade last night in London session I woke up super late I actually woke up early I woke up like around 9:1 in the morning and I look I'm looking at the chge through my phone like this like half awake with one eye I'm like Oh Marcus not doing anything I'm not going to wake up slept a little bit in the morning caught up on some sleep because bro this challenge has literally literally been draining me right cuz I stay up during London session throughout the week messes up my sleep schedule on the weekend and I'm just all over the place so I finally caught up on some sleep oh look look look look look look look another Traer putting up oh another unprofitable Trader hello hello how are you welcome look good this guy always looks fresh I can hear to take the traits you know we got no traits let's go back up so trade update currently let's start off with GBP nzd so GBP nzd we have obviously been waiting for a reaction from the strong level of support to take the trade to the upside yesterday once we had this push to the upside I anticipated for price to have a pull back into here then have an entry and truthfully that's where I would be looking to enter this position right at this point but I was not active in front of the charts at 2: in the morning as you guys can see down here so this Candlestick at 2: in the morning I was not interested in taking the trade now I could be entering the trade but since it is currently 12:00 in Miami there's no Market volume so I'm just going to set and forget and wait for this daily Candlestick to close in about 4 hours to see if it closes under this round psychological level or above and then I'm going to determine whether I want to enter the buy or the sell next nzd JPY we are still in this channel simply waiting for a breakout out of it to enter the trade patience is key in markets at these times GBP CHF still waiting for price to break on the destru level to enter a sell might enter a little highrisk sell now so GBP CHF basically waiting for a break and read this under here to sell or might take a higher risk trade here nzd CAD we're still monitoring this to see if it actually has a real reaction from this point or if it doesn't GBP JPY is probably my next favorite prayer because it is confirming that we are in this very strong consolidation zone right here and I'm going to be waiting for price to have a break and retest out of this consolidation to then enter this trade very clear level of support very clear level of resistance break and retest is going to be key to making money with this trade it's going to be super super super simple and then lastly GBP JPY once again we're having a very strong level of support here and resistance waiting for a break and retest under it's like what I said the cleanest ones are the JPY which going to for whichever want to give us the cleanest move to then enter the position for this week so as of right now market update it is currently 1217 not much else we can do other than set and forget yesterday we went on the boat so let's see where today takes us what is that all right ladies and gentlemen trade update it is currently 7:13 in the afternoon before we do this trade update let's take a ginger shot this is not a sponsor Ginger sa are made for a man you know what's funny people might think I work out I haven't worked out in like two weeks that c for right there all right trade update currently right now markets are literally exactly the same GBP and ZD close exactly how I anticipated with the daily above the round psychological level and the supports I'm going to be looking for entries on this very very very soon on the 1 hour time frame next nzd JPY still within this channel daily time frame close as a dogee at the top of this resistance this might be the Candlestick that gives it the strong rejection to then head to the downside GBP CHF we are still waiting for this to have the shift to the downside very nice daily dogee which looks fantastic GBP JPY we've had a very strong daily Doge as well waiting for the break and retest out of this box to enter the position to the downside and as of right now as you guys can see we are currently at the same balance of $ 22,690 so now we're going to go play some basketball probably hit the gym for the first time in two three weeks and most importantly we're going to Walmart you guys don't understand why it's important there is three men living in this house right now we're surviving just off purely Uber Eats like that is literally how we're surviving right now we have dried out the cabinets we've dried out the freezer we've eaten eating the cat food I've haven't been to Walmart in over a year I'm just so passionate I want to go probably get some stuff and see where we go from [Music] [Applause] there 100 [Applause] [Music] better I get it right [Music] now you stay no GM two weeks why yeah you want some of these good I got to tast it too zero sugar on these electrolytes no promo whatever that's dope [ __ ] sugar right no dude but it's like you got to get the healthier ones bro you got to only get pasteurized eggs are brother we're at Walmart we got to at least make an effort got you got just no shot you're never going to do it dude there it goes oh [ __ ] ah ah it's not the size of the boat it's the motion in the ocean only last so long good morning ladies and gentlemen touch that touch that what you guys know about week seven turning $100 into a million I I I thought I had just reversed on a so I was like oh [ __ ] currently right now we are up $4,000 on the trade now I'm not excited because get to these $44,000 I could give a [ __ ] I'm excited about the potential of this trade that we have taken if you have seen last week series you saw the loss we avoided on this position price had the push stop then push that's what we are anticipating for this week to come ahead so we avoided not making any money this week simply because because we have experience in the market now let's look at it now so trade update we are currently up $4,000 on GBP CHF so if you guys saw last night's trade update I explained that I was looking to enter a trade right around this area once we had the retest to then sell So currently right now GBP CHF has a very strong double top formation currently creating right now very strong bearish move if this trade hits all the way down here here we'll [ __ ] sweep 1 to 11 risk to reward meaning we will take right now we have 35 Lots right so 35 Lots means that it's $350 per pip so we do $350 per pip times a take profit of 342 Pips so $350 time 342 Pips drum roll please these $100,000 in one single position the beauty of this is not this we're going to get to this no matter what what is the beauty is how much I'm actually putting at risk so I'm only putting at risk so we have 30 pip stop loss so if I do $350 per pip times $30 I'm only putting at risk 50% of the account this is key to growth so I'm literally risking 50% to almost 5x the account tell me that's not a [ __ ] great deal so as of right now we are currently just waiting for this position to have a confirmation body chemist closure in the next 27 minutes under this level of support right here the other markets like GBP nzd we avoided this loss last night by not entering the position here so it's a beautiful loss avoided and we simply remove move this market for us being interested for the Buys so we're not interested in the buys well not just yet we got to confirm if this Candlestick is going to close above or under nzd JPY is still in this channel heading to the upside we are just remaining patient we are in no rush GJ we are still waiting for price to have the break and retest under to actually be able to be interested in this position so still waiting on that and then nzd CAD we're just still watching GBP CHF actively right now is the baby now GBP CHF is actually something very interesting that I might have not told you guys before GBP CHF is actually the pair that made me my money back in 2020 I was only trading GBP CHF that was how actually passed challenge how I got my first payout it was on juv PCF which is right around here right around this Market time over here so get it on I think it's yeah it's right here it's on the weekly time frame so back around over here when this was a very strong resistance level you you can see the dates down here right this is all facts 2020 down here this was at a very strong resistance and I caught the break and retest out of that resistance I caught this whole entire move not just one move but scalings throughout this whole entire move I can almost guarantee you if I go down to the Daily and I go back this far yeah look at that there's still markups from that point back then like I would enter throughout this whole oh look you can tell that I would mark it up because there's like little circles and little dots that's probably like on the 1 hour time frame Char doesn't go back that far on the 1 hour but I have not taken a trade on GBP CHF in a very long time in 2 years so let's see if this can actually make us some money how it did back in the day so for now market update is currently 1034 in the morning and we are up as of this very moment right now oh [ __ ] I had a pull back $2700 so I didn't forget 44 44 4 4 44 44 40 I should actually hit M [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] because we are almost up $44,000 on the profit for the week meaning we are about to hit the take profit for the week exactly as I expect let me show you guys the trade where it is right now so once again we're currently up 41 oh $40,000 right now earlier about an hour and a half ago it was right around here and this is exactly what I explained we need to price the body close under that structure point to confirm that we're going to end the downside now we are currently approaching this support level and we are very strongly breaking under the key here is going to be that we remain under this so we can have a little retest to then sell but we have to come to a decision at that point should we just close at 40,000 or do we hold that trade through that pullback which it could realistically potentially go back further than this right here why well because on The Daily time frame if the daily Candlestick let's say a body closes like this it can have a retest to then this structural level here now that's just going to be a lot bigger retracement to than this point now we can then potentially get a little Wick out that can then go into our take profits on look look look look my boys are calling me CU are training yo you're didn't C GBP THS cuz you didn't want to but I sent you a signal no bro what do you mean bro I what do you mean I didn't catch it you lost that [ __ ] oh yeah you want a bet you want to face him text I I sent you that TR yesterday oh oh you sent me the JT huh yest yeah right no it's clean I mean it's going to have a pullback though not going to lie no it is it is yeah it's going to have a did you take it no I didn't take it bro bro what the [ __ ] yo I just sent you the signal oh so you send me the signal you don't take it that sounds like such a guru thing to do no no I'm I'm in it though I'm definitely in it five fine was a clean it was a clean set up yeah it'll have a pullback and then you should enter on the pullback okay all right d forget sending me the signal okay so yeah pretty much 4H hour Candlestick looks very strong very bearish engulfing can then wait for little retest as well for then that structure level right there basically more of the story all we got to do right now is set forget just looks so lovely dude like we're finally like making some type of decent money like look at this man [Music] LeBron and [Music] Wade we another want a trade today where's the tra we just set three wins in a row I know I made it edit it like if I made it good morning ladies and gentlemen it's a bit of a late morning because I thought I would have this fixed by this time but clearly I don't So currently right now it is 11:25 in the morning now I am not upset because the position is indeed back into around our entry level or where we would have been a little bit in a draw down and I say would have been because last night you know I decided to close the positions as it was going back into our entry point cuz I believed it was going to keep going but when I Clos these positions on the way to the entry point the amount of slippage that I have received is something I've never seen in my whole entire life and this is a brand new broker that I just decided to test out literally this week because I believe it was going to be the one that I was going to share with you guys because they had a really good offering no commissions pretty much no spread but I guess I didn't account the slippage that they would be putting into your accounts CU this is actually the first position that I take on this broker on the challeng just in general and I'm definitely going to be changing platforms as of today I'm going to withdraw all my money and then I'm going to go to a different one which I actually know the guys that are behind it and that they are running it but the offer wasn't as attractive as the one that I'm using right now I decided you know what let me go for the clickbait and most attractive thing which on once again it uh that type of offer like what what is too good to be true it always ends up never working out exactly what happened right now the offer was too good and I simply got caught in this whole entire slippage movement and I was brought in by the really great market conditions cuz I want you guys to have the best market conditions if you want to start your own 100 to the mill but this broker that I'm currently use right now is not it so I'm going to switch to this other one next week because it's it's a lot more corporate fees are a little bit higher but I can almost guarante to you this type of stuff will never happen but I am going to test it out before you guys even do cuz up to this point of the challenge I have not marketed any broker in the whole entire challenge the previous challenge or my whole entire trading career I'm very very very selective I'm very picky how I would ever want to do this so this next one we're going to test it out once again and see how it is but I'm so tired because this happened last night like at 3:00 4 in the morning and I've been battling with the teams of the broker to see how they can fix this I don't even care about fixing the profits it's not a big deal it's more of like the the morals behind this let me show you guys so this is the trades from last night gbpchf you guys can clearly see that we closed out all three positions at the same exact time one of them is in profit and then the other got split in half or whatever and then it was in a loss so GBP CHF last night I explained if we had a retest of this level and then a rejection to the downside we can very easily continue to head down if not if we body Clos above we can come back right into our area of Interest so we body closed above and as I'm seeing this body close above and then I'm seeing this rejection from the EMA but then I see this retest of this level of support that every single time we're above we're clearly heading up I say oh [ __ ] this is the area where I want to get out cuz I could get pushed right back into my entry and I don't want to be in a loss at this point in the challenge I'm doing so well so decided to close my position right at that line right there right at 1.12 282 right at 3:00 in the morning 4: in the morning which is like when London session is kicking in you guys can see down here the times and I closed out the first position right the 20 Lots so the 20 Lots gave me $2,000 in profit now we're going to do some calculations right now because if I enter the position up at this point right here and then we close out the position let's say somewhere in here that is a total of about 23 Pips but for argument sake let's say 20 Pips so I am currently risking $200 per pip so it's going to be $200 time 20 Pips I'm supposed to be up $4,000 on that position I'm up $2,000 so they ate up 50% of my profits but that's fine you know what high fees I'll take it whatever not a big deal but then the other position when I go close it it is then in a loss why did I take a loss on the same position that I entered at the same spot and close at the same spot why did it close at a loss now this is where I get very skeptical about these platforms because it's just so unnecessary like I just I just don't get it and this is why I also split my lot sizes because everybody says oh why don't you just take 180 lot it's for this very same exact reason if I were to take 80 Lots in a position it would literally have one full slip without position versus if I split the positions in half at least I get one and then the other ones probably have a little bit of slippage so I I do this because I've dealt with this [ __ ] before and I've been dealing it for a very long time but I do believe this next platform I'm going to be a lot better because personally I've I've always had it there in the back burning these guys have always mentioned it to me but i' I've never wanted to pay higher fees but I'm at the point where I want to pay high fees but get the best market conditions so as of right now this is where we are on the challenge on the account basically we're pretty much at the same starting balance for the week GBP CHF I do believe it could continue to have a push to the downside on The Daily time frame we're having a very strong pull back into this level not what I expected as that far but did expect it to have this 4H hour rejection Candlestick and if we do body Candlestick close under in the next hour and a half we can very clearly easily continue to head to the downside especially if the 1 hour has a body Candlestick closure under this higher low because before this was a lower high lower low lower high lower low and now we have a higher high next GBP nzd daily time frame has now closed very strongly under so we're going to be waiting for a retest to them sell nzd JPY is still in this channel we are currently just waiting for it to have a break and retest out of it GBP JPY still in the channel waiting for the break and retest out of it and then nzd CAD looks like it's having a pullback but not even interested and lastly audjpy we are currently waiting for this break and read to out so [ __ ] man I just hate I hate I hate shady [ __ ] like this cuz I'm doing everything as legit and as transparent as I can possibly do it and there's outside sources that are affecting the work that I'm putting into this challenge I'm supposed to be up right now probably let's say $30,000 even with the position being closed at that point but because of the slippage and because of all that now I get set back so I'm I'm this is why I don't want to promote a broker to you guys because I want to make sure it's good I don't want you guys to have to deal with this [ __ ] that I'm dealing with right now I don't want to have that type of responsibility so I'm going to try uh the new this new broker if you know I see some opportunities this week which I doubt it or if not as of next week we're going to start off with a new opportunity as of right now pretty much at the same starting balance on the accounts so bummer bummer bummer bummer look who we have back I've had it for a week and a half it already had to go in for service $40,000 [ __ ] dollar service so took the unnecessary loss of the slippage from the broker today and then a $40,000 bill from the Bugatti but she's back we always got security with us SP always why [Music] not these young guys out here they brought Bugatti watch to do some videos of the Bugatti it's pretty sick it looks like the back of the Bugatti this size is the prim oh what the [ __ ] [Music] [Music] I just don't understand how he understands how to do it so well yo I Lear I learned how to do the [ __ ] the what the Yeah I learned how to do the 360 60 I learned this I think kid in the back huh I think kids in the back oh they're tripping all right right [Music] there good morning ladies and gentlemen it is currently 7:55 in in the morning so usually I don't do trade up this this early usually I'm looking at the Trad for my phone on my bed but today I decided to wake up early and go out on the boat we got nothing else to do today it's Friday no trades in the market not interested on taking a trade at this time because usually the market slows down right around 11:00 so I only have about 3 hours of trading so in order instead of me just staying here and kind of doing nothing today I go on the boat so let me actually show you guys another loss that we avoided and how this one simple trick has cost me over $200,000 of and took me about 2 years to figure out so yesterday we had GP CHF the whole entire [ __ ] REM move that this obviously came back then here I was looking to then potentially enter this trade again to the downside but obviously I cannot enter a sell unless this time frame is bearish clearly right here you can see lower low lower high lowerer low cool right right so as of right now this is the lower high time frame right here I mean that's the lower high and then this lower low point is right here the moment we body close Above This lower high we then go bullish we body closed Above So now this goes bullish as the higher high and then the higher low moves to this higher low point this is now the higher low and the higher high I can't take a trade here off just a bearish engulfing when this structure is clearly bullish but you know what sometimes you can do this on a different time frame so if you see up top over here we're going to change now to the 15 minute time frame usually the 15minute time frame can show you that shift of structure beforehand I'm just going to take off this wrist to reward this so it looks a lot more clear so this is clearly the 15minute higher low higher high just put this simple higher low higher high higher low higher high so this is the higher low and then this is the higher high we are supposed to take the trade the moment we B Candlestick close under this line right here to confirm a shift of structure this will then mean that the 15-minute time frame is now bearish what happened here the not body kind of stay close under so there is no shift structure so we did not take the trade on the 1 hour this is what it would look like right there on the structure I bring back the risk to reward tool going to spam this button back this is where we should have entered the position on this shift of structure on the 1 hour this is what it looks like but we did not because there was no shift of structure so then hence what we did is we simply avoided this loss because there was no shif of structure see how easy it is you have to have area of Interest well Trend area of Interest entry signal Shi of structure so we avoided this loss to Perfection GBP nzd this is definitely going to be a trade that is going to be ready for next week once we have this retest of this neckline right here this retest of this neckline is going to be key to continue selling this Market to end the downside nzdjpy 4our time frame still in this bullish Channel we simply have to set and forget GBP JPY is now at the top of this ranging Market oh GP JP there you go that is one again at the top of this ranging market and this looks beautiful on the weekly time frame if it decides to close just like that doy Candlestick because then this would be a beautiful resistance that then we can res like resist from and then sell to the downside on this following week and I simply get a horizontal line from this point right here and I drag it to the left it's clearly a very well respect the level of support and resistance so this trade will be ready for next week nzd CAD we had a pretty decent move to the upside so we technically did miss this one can't even lie and then AUD JPY we have not had the breaking retest under we're currently approaching this very strong level of support and resistance and have to wait for that reaction so as of right now nothing this is going to be an amazing week next week I felt as if all of this week the pairs and the markets were getting ready for next week and there's some weeks that are like that some weeks are going to be slow and they're going to be prepping for the next week and you just have to sit on your hands and not put money at risk when there's nothing to put money at risk kind of how I did this week I put very little bit of money at risk for obviously a great reward but I think this week was loading up for next week so let's check out what's going to happen next week so we're going to not go on the boat probably play a little montage and see where the day takes us hopefully it doesn't rain it's a beautiful day as of right now let's hope it doesn't rain on us out there that would Prett [Music] suck did you not check the weather before we came out yeah I did I check it that way we'll make it to the beach at least we get to go to Fisher Island have you ever been no have you been never been no your experience I see this as a positive did we not bring one of those portable chargers we did yeah let's try it let's try and charge it well here we find ourselves in the same situation as last time a broken [Music] bat trading is like the beach when a Trader goes to his office he expects to then take a tra when a surfer comes to the beach he expects to Surf a wave but if Ser goes to the beach and there's no waves you can't do anything you're not going to go out there and get risk eaten by a shark like literally there's no waves to Surf like right now you can't do anything if you go to your trading desk and there's no trades to take you can't do anything there's no point of view overexposing risk when there's no great opportunities in the markets there's no points of you coming out to the beach and trying to Surf when there's no waves now there's a suck that you had to drive to the beach and you had to get your surfboard and go through traffic to get here yes but it's part of the game does a suck that you have to wake up early look at the market for 2 hours and then you don't get your entry signal yes it sucks but it's part of the game it's the risk reward of the business that we're involved right now so days like today where the market gives us no opportunities we just come to the beach s for [Music] I need a bigger boat and we do after this one yeah I said like this is already like this is the third time this is the last draw yeah this is the last straw I'm getting a bigger bat n for real I'm getting it's raining after the rain what comes after the rain buddy what comes after the rain a winning trade more rain literally Miami right here fact Sunny one second ago and now yeah now don't bro dude now it's Shin sh shining all the way over there I'm ladies and gentlemen we have made it home so has been an interesting day you know what I thought it was going to take you guys through a fun Vlog and it was going to be a great time not saying it it wasn't but it just didn't go according to plan you know we went a long long way we just went the wrong [ __ ] way we ended up at the wrong spot but it is what it is this week has consisted of a bunch of different interesting events that have happened so let's see what next week has ahead for us for next week we're going to deposit these $20,000 into this new broker that I am going to be testing out which I will be letting you guys know next week how that broker Works hopefully it's a lot better than this one uh it's a lot more corporate it's a lot more structured and it's a little bit more expensive fees but I won't have these slippage which is extremely annoying so if you guys want to be part of the cause of me where I Lally share these trades every single week with my students click the link in description below I'm going to literally give

I Turned $20,000 Into $90,278 in 7 Days Trading Forex
 Sep 8, 2024
 
 it's week eight of me turning $100 into a Million last week we took two trades where one of them made us about $2,000 and then the other we lost a $2,000 biggest waste of time ever and now this week we're going to come and Slash the market where we're going to try and turn these $20,000 into $40,000 good evening ladies and gentlemen it is week number eight turning $100 into a million and all I can say is that we usually start Monday morning very early Monday morning because cuz Sunday usually nothing happens but not this time this time is different you know what I think this is the first time in the whole entire challenge we start Challenge on a Sunday and this might be the Sunday that we just take a trade on Sunday night and it can give us the profits for the whole entire week so let's see currently right now it is 1:58 in the morning so it is 2: in the morning Sunday night Monday morning so right now I'm supposed to be asleep but I'm here about to take a trade so there's a lot of markets that I am interested in taking this week but 50% of these markets are degenerate markets now you guys know what that means degenerate markets means I'm breaking my trading plan if I break my trading plan I have to drive the beetle now I haven't driven the beetle in about 3 weeks cuz I haven't broken my trading plan in 3 weeks but if I break my trading plan I am a man of my word I will not drive my 3.4 million Bugatti to drive the beetle to show you guys that you have to hold yourself accountable every single time you break a trading plan but as right now we haven't done it so let's see if we're about to do it so starting off the week is going to be audusd as you guys can see the degenerate markets I have Beetle at the top of it because these are the markets if I do take this trade I'm going to have to drive the [ __ ] Beetle currently right now audusd is at a high of a resistance so you can see how we are at a resistance level and resistance level so you guys can see here on the weekly time frame every single time price comes up into this resistance one we rejection comes up into this resistance one we rejection and then hits to the downside currently right now we've had the pullup the one we rejection just as it's done here and we could anticipate a pullback we're at a higher high so we could anticipate price to take a pullback to then continue to head to the upside now this is a counter trend trade because we're trading against the daily time frame and the weekly daily time frame is still bullish creating higher high higher low higher high but the 4H hour time frame has shifted bearish now we've used this channel in the past in the last couple of weeks and it has worked very precisely not saying that we want to use it this week but it's just so I visual representation you guys can see how we were bullish and now we broken under that channel the structure has gone bearish this was the higher low higher high we broken under now we have a left head kind of right shoulder going on and this is literally exactly where I would want to be interested in entering this position literally like right like I can basically take this trade right [ __ ] now like literally right now but I only like taking positions right at the beginning of London session especially on a Sunday London session starts in 1 hour but this might have the move before that is what literally driving me crazy because if we go to the weekly time frame the weekly time frame has already created that Wick so usually what happens is when the weekly Candlestick opens it just either has the move but then it always has to go back and create the wick this has already created the wick so it doesn't have to go back up here so technically the trade could be ready to be taken but I am going to wait for a little bit more confirmation on this position potentially going to be another bearish engulfing Candlestick so it's a confirmed rejection from this area here us audusd is borderline about to take it and if I take it that means Beetle time or also known as The Punisher next is going to be USD JPY which is not a degenerate trade you can clearly see here on the weekly time frame we are very much bearish we were creating higher high higher low higher high and then we went bearish lower high lower low and now we're retesting this weekly structure level when you go down to the Daily time frame you can see here on the daily time frame this is a very well respected level of resistance support support support resistance resistance support so whenever we're above a rejecting whenever we're under we are rejecting now I'm about to show you guys some crazy voodoo magic [ __ ] and again this okay obviously it's not [ __ ] voodoo magic right let's be [ __ ] honest it's Market structure repetition constantly the markets will repeat it s because these patterns happen time and time again this is about to trip you guys out what I'm about to show you guys if you guys like these type of examples and they make sense to you guys drop a comment below so I can keep doing it because it's a very high level of analyzation in the markets and it's almost like where's Waldo like when you have this big image of where's Waldo and once you find them you almost can't unsee it but before you find them it's pretty much impossible to find them but when you find them it's very hard to then see it but I'm about to show you guys right now you are not seeing it as soon as I show it to you you can't unsee it's going to look super clear so let me show you guys so this market right here currently is having a lower high pullback and this is what this Market structure looks like on this pullback right we have some structure right here and then we are now at this resistance level if I take this same exact Market structure move from right here and then I simply move it to this Market structure here with an exception of of making this a little bit higher and aiming this a little bit higher it's the exact same move right here but instead of it obviously being here it is now right here it's the same exact move with the exception of bit being a little bit higher now what is the difference that this had this [ __ ] the structure up here and that this one is having it right here let's see what happened here to see if we could anticipate for it to happen here cuz we're expecting for the cells and clearly this one to did this pattern it then went to the downside so let's zoom into this 30 minutes structure on this circle time frame right here what did we get when we were at this pattern right here oh okay we got a left head right shoulder okay cool left head right shoulder retest then sell well let's go to current price right now holy [ __ ] what do we have here left head right shoulder [ __ ] with me [ __ ] with me if you want me to keep showing you guys cuz I see this all the time and I don't always explain it because I it's just normal to me this is my second language third language and I see this literally every single day it's very normal to me but to a lot of you guys this might be like what the [ __ ] a wow moment and if it is let me know in the comments so I can keep doing this up for you guys cuz it motivates me and it shows me that you guys are actually learning so this position we're actually very very very interested in executing but not just yet I want to execute this position once we have some type of engulfing cont confirmation as of right now I have my potential entry right under this level because when this Candlestick closes under it it is a engulfing Candlestick so just put my alarm under there to pretty much notify me once we have that engulfing Candlestick even the 15 minute hasn't had the engulfing quite just yet so we're going to stay up all night tonight because that literally might happen very very very soon next is GBP JPY so this pair we've been anticipating since last week and currently right now we are at this resistance level once again 4-Hour time frame we're just in this consolidation this is very easy break retest to then sell retest of structure retest of EMA and retest of round psychological level 190.5 next AUD JPY literally same exact thing we're at now this very strong level of support and resistance all throughout here and I'm simply going to be waiting for price to have a break and retest under this level to then take this trade to the the downside very easy very straight to the point next degenerate trade Beetle trade if I take this trade right here which I should not I will then have to drive the beetle so this was a pair that we were interested in last week that we were interested in selling at the retest of this neckline but that never happened and price had to push to the downside now I believe this is going to be the move that's going to retest the neckline of GBP nzd and The Head and Shoulders but I see an opportunity on that retest this is the degenerate trade you should not be looking to take this trade that is a no you should be looking to take this sell but this counter Trend trade does look pretty decent we've clearly created a triple bottom and now we are potentially going to break out of that area to then take this trade the 1H hour time frame is clearly consolidating and now we're are about to break out of this area along with the EMA in order for me to execute this trade I'd basically need a break and a retest and I'd only look for a very quick shortterm buy to just retest this neckline of the overall Head and Shoulders pattern that we have right here this is a counter Trend trade and again when I take a counter Trend trade I am breaking my trading plan and my trading rules therefore if I do that I have to go drive the beetle but as of right now there is no break and no retest but we're going to keep our eye on it just in case if it were to do it so this is the second degenerate trade that if you were to take it we would have to drive the Beetle and then lastly nzdjpy not even that focused on it because we have way better markets that we're going to be interested in for this week ahead so I'm going to keep my eye peeled out on usdjpy and on audusd so drum roll 2:09 in the morning see you guys either in a couple of hours or tomorrow in the morning s and forget all right guys so trade update it is currently right now 3:34 in the middle of the night so usually what happens is that I'll start falling asleep here at the desk so I just literally go take a shower wakes me up and I just come back so I just take a shower right now and I'm currently waiting for the market to give you my entry signal probably be up for another hour um just see what the market does nothing's changed everything's exactly the same let me show you USD JPY still waiting for the rejection audusd still waiting for the rejection and the GBP still waiting for the break under everything is literally still exactly the same GBP nzd has started to have the break so let's wait for that retest now but I think USD JPY is going to be the first one that I'm going to be interested in taking so little trade update at 3:35 we will see what happens next if not I'll see you in the morning good morning ladies and gentlemen ah so last night we fell asleep at around 4:30 almost 5: in the morning and we have just gotten up it is currently 9:58 in the morning so Sebastian my filmmaker usually is here with me but last night he fell asleep at 52 this guy can't wake up he can't hang can't hang with the boy I'm already used to this whole sleep schedule I am fried so I can fall asleep at 5: and wake up at 7:00 like if I slept 6 hours but I didn't and I did all that for nothing nothing the markets haven't done nothing this is what I hate when I put it all this time and I literally don't catch any trades or have any high probability trade opportunities but you know what it's part of the game it's part of the risk to reward of this business I got to suck it up a lot of you guys got to do that too realize that even if you stay up and there's nothing happens don't feel timely invested and like okay now because I've been sitting on this chair for 6 hours I have to then take a trade and the market has to give me an opportunity no dude that is not going to happen so let me show you guys what I mean so beforehand you guys can see that the account currently right now is still sitting at the same $2,000 and here the markets you can see audusd currently has had the push to the area of interest just how we wanted to and we haven't had the rejection that we've been looking for so we just had that engulfing about 2 hours ago which this is going to pretty much give me my confirmation that I might be wanting to enter this trade very very very soon 30 minute time frame I want to have the break of this little neckline of The Head and Shoulders before I actually enter this position so it can just confirm that it's rejecting this area of Interest next is gbpnzd so we've actually had the break out of this area now I'm going to be waiting for the deeper retest of it in order for us to actually take this trade to the upside 4H hour looks very very very very nice just waiting for the little higher low to now enter this position to the upside USD JPY currently literally did nothing I thought this was going to be the pair that we were going to take and it was going to give us the opportunity but it never gave us that rejection Eng engulfing Candlestick that we were looking for and it completely avoided this loss to Perfection so for now I am not interested in USD JPY GBP JPY same exact thing we were anticipating for price to have a break and retest under this level and we didn't so we avoided this loss as well and then AUD JPY waiting for the break and reach the under we didn't do it so we avoided this loss as well so you guys can see how pretty much some of the analysis are playing out in our favor in terms of what we're looking for to enter the position and then the others just simply didn't now what do we do in that case we said and forget we we move on and only focus on the markets that matter there's no need to take a trade in a market that we are emotionally invested to or timely invested into it just because we stayed up on night looking at it no we only take trades that have a high probability trade setup and if those trades don't have a high probability trade setup even if we looked at it for 30 days we simply don't take it don't care if it's your favorite pair don't care if your uh if it's the pair has the same letters as your name or if there's a birthday uh all this superstitious [ __ ] [ __ ] that it doesn't matter what matters is if it has a high probability trait and none of them don't so let's see if audusd or gbpnzd give us the entry signals that we need so once again it's currently 10:00 in the morning and I will update you guys hopefully within the hour all right guys market update it is currently 1217 in the afternoon so about 2 and 1 half hours is the last time we did the last market update patience patience patience I can't describe how much patience factors in to becoming successful in trading because it avoids so many different losses I just avoided three losses in one day because of patience so let me show you right now the trade that we were interested in taking a couple hours ago and how we just avoided the loss so audusd we were interested in taking this trade as soon as we broke and retested under this neck line as you can clearly see it did not break and retest under the neck line it created the right shoulder but it never retested and rejected it so we did not take the trade patience patience patience this is the key to success right here you can't just get fomo because you see this pattern right here and you feel like you have to get in because it's going to have the push if it has the push phenomenal great that's what you want cuz it's going to confirm to you that the move is actually happened and you just wait for the little pullback to then enter but you can't get foam mod just because you see the pattern because the pattern happens doesn't mean that it has to have the move so we avoided that loss to Perfection I I'm still very much interested in it I just have to wait for now this Market to have a better rejection from this area of interest and then gvp nzd we are still waiting for price to have the retest of this structure level to take the trade to the upside oh look who's back huh been doing trade up this by myself huh thanks for coming back to work no you don't get one of those until you haven't been here all week I've been doing this by myself holding the camera like this sucks so we finally have seas back he decided to come back to work welcome back brother this deed to wake up yeah literally it is right now 12:57 at night pretty much about to be 1 in the morning trade update the market has played out drum roll please we got a pump at the gym today can you tell one of these days I'm going to get a cramp from that's going of suck but yeah we hit the gym and the market has moved exactly how we've been anticipating so earlier on 8 UD USD we were anticipating for price to have a break of this neckline right here I was showing you guys on the 30 minute time frame the market did have the break but I was waiting for the retest did not have the retest and I [ __ ] missed the whole entire move but I do believe that this Market could have a pullback now in London session and then in New York it's going to have the push again just having to move very early on into the session and I feel like it's not just done yet I feel like this is going to Wick back up on the daily time frame feel like the 1 hour time frame has to create that lower high it's going to give us that beautiful entry to then head to the downside gvp nzd never had the retest how we wanted it so price literally just went straight to the upside good thing we avoided this trade right here because honestly I did not want to drive the beetle so this trade made us avoid taking the trade on the beetle fantastic because now what we can do is put the money at risk on the real position so we avoided taking this counter Trend trade and now we're going to look for the retest of the cells of this neckline of The Head and Shoulders next is USD JPY currently you guys can see that we're having some type of reaction but we're having it at the top of this level of support and resistance the only way that I would be interested in this position is once and if we decide to have a break and retest at this level to then head to the downside daily time frame Clos very strongly bullish and the daily time frame is now bullish because we've broken above here the least that I can ask for on this position is for the 4H hour to go bearish in order for us to be interested in this trade same thing with GBP JPY we've had a push to the upside daily creating above the level of support and resistance throughout here very strong resistance very strong support we've closed above so it could retest and head to the upside so not that interested and lastly AUD JPY same exact thing broke above the resistance using it as support running out we can potentially head to the upside now what I'm going to be waiting for on this is the same thing a break and retest under so the main pair that is about to be ready to enter is audusd like I said and it had the [ __ ] move we just missed it now I'm just going to wait for this trade to have the pullback to enter the trade and gbpnzd a rejection to then sell looks like it's going to be another really long night don't fall asleep today [ __ ] got my rest so all right we're good bet stay tuned don't miss another trade [ __ ] drum roll please drum roll please mother [ __ ] trade update 19,000 [ __ ] dollars in profit now what how fast did this happen very fast let me show you guys so right now USD JPY exactly how I explained yesterday we literally explained the only way we'd be interested in taking this position right here is if we have a break retest and then sell price literally broke retested sell exactly what we anticipated perfect entry signal literally 1 hour ago as you guys can see down here a 8:00 in the morning currently right now it is 10:00 in the morning so as soon as we entered this position Market immediately started heading to the downside look how fast this momentum of this Market is currently moving beautiful 30 minutes bearish engulfing evening St formation 15-minute time frame as soon as the Candlestick close boom just completely downside move which is absolutely beautiful this is the trade that we avoided yesterday and we avoided to take the loss cuz never retested and gave us the engulfing of this left head and the right shoulder now avoided this loss we can remove this now we're have this position right here we're is looking decent right obviously I'm just hyped because I risked a lot more than I should have because we're trying to turn $20,000 into 40 so I can literally close the position right now and then we will have the $40,000 in profit that we need literally oh oh [ __ ] oh oh oh what oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] just happened oh [ __ ] oh oh whoa whoo whoo whoo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo don't you [ __ ] do it hold on I'm in the I'm in shock right now yo I saw 50,000 it was it was at the bottom of that Wick right there is news happening right now probably well now I'm on edge I'm going to put an alarm right around my entry signal just to let me know that it is up there I have to put a an alarm at the bottom of this Candlestick if we if we get a Candlestick to go back under that Wick we're pretty much good we are good okay you don't want this all right so currently right now we had a little quick uh spazz in the markets this is what trading in the market is this is why people go crazy when they risk more money than they should if I was risking you know 3 4 5% like a normal human I wouldn't even care oh right now $40,000 cting and profit that's it all we care about next audusd so yesterday we anticipated after this lower low that we were going to have a lower high pullback to retest this structure level and then the EMA to head to the downside price did not do that so we clearly did not enter this position GBP CHF oh [ __ ] look at this beautiful trade so we have pulled up to the area of interest of the head and shoulders time frame exactly how we've been anticipating and we are officially having our reaction Candlestick from this area now if you go down to the one hour you can very clearly see how we shifted the structure right here we went from higher high higher low higher high to now lower low this is great phenomenal amazing Perfecto now what we have to do is wait for a lower high to then sell this position just exactly how we did here lower low lower high engulfing sell lower low need the lower high engulfing and then sell so this is exactly what we did here we had the lower low lower high engulfing and then sell you guys just seen the [ __ ] pattern here it's literally the same [ __ ] every single time this [ __ ] got this [ __ ] got me hyped right now we we we can't even look at it we can't it's going to [ __ ] with us we got to just set it forget if this trade hits down here you know we'll be like at 150,000 right you understand that do you have that clear this Candlestick just opened and didn't yeah there was definitely news let me actually go check if there was news okay there you go so we actually did have news right now at 10:00 a.m. Tuesday September 3rd 10: in the morning USD red flag I manufacturing blah clearly you can see how fundamentals always follow technicals this is the perfect example of it obviously it's going to have a little spasm like but the overall move is going to follow the technical analysis of it so for now last market update to right now at 10:04 in the morning so the last update right now at 10:05 in the morning is going to be $225,000 in profit said I forget so by the way yes this is a real weapon it's never been loaded before it's never been used I kind of just like it for decoration this sh was $5,000 goldplated col 45 you know I just feel like a feel like a narc with this [ __ ] you know so trade update right it's kind of annoying because every single [ __ ] trade that I predict I've been I've been predicting them I've just been so selective about it which is good but it's also bad cuz I'm getting a little bit of a fear inside of me but I'm a man I got this and I got to lead by example and I'm showing you guys this is part of the Journey of the 100 to the mill we started off good not giving a [ __ ] and now I'm at the point where I'm giving too much of a [ __ ] cuz I don't want to blow the account but I got to remove that mindset it's a limited belief so I can continue to scale the account trying to get this across to you guys right so trade up there right now the account is currently at 3,00 ,400 and you guys can see that the position is actively pulling back further than we anticipated and I actually want the 4 Hour to close like this I wanted to close a very strong dogee because then the next Candlestick should fill that very very very well the 1 hour just closed right now along with the 30 minutes as as a nice 30 minute dogee if this next Candlestick could have this right here beautiful amazing we we we need that cuz this would be literally the same pattern is right here to then continue selling to the downside but I might close this position out to then potentially enter gbpnzd Because this is the one that is actually retesting the daily neckline of The Head and Shoulders a lot cleaner it's retesting and rejecting the EMA the round psychological level this trade just overall looks a lot better and I might just remove the liability from the other pair and just transfer it to this one so I'm going to be waiting for the to pull back on some rejections here and then there I'll determine the decision that I made and it's so annoying because we've been calling this position since yesterday we never got the pull back and the trade has been moving [ __ ] beautifully but it is what it is we're going to continue to monitor this trade literally every single tick like I am here on the 15minute time frame watching every single tick because if this position comes into like look where I have my alarm I had I have alarm set up 1469 that's about the 30 minute EMA 1 hour EMA if it gets there I think it could just continue breaking to the upside so if it gets there I'm just going to close my losses there and then just move on to the next one cuz I'm not like at this point in the challenge if the position from right away doesn't go straight into profit and just stays there I am going to Simply cut my losses but if the position goes straight into a loss I can't do anything about it but if the position goes from a winning position to then up to a losing one I'd be dumb to not close it out if it was a regular trade I wouldn't give a [ __ ] but since we're in the challenge I have to be very strategic because clearly the trade might not go in the direction that I am anticipating a trade is supposed to go from the moment you enter it straight into your takeprofit or straight into your stop loss but if it goes in between and it starts going back like it doesn't hit your takeprofit and it starts going back up into your stop loss well the trade might just reverse be a you know be a step ahead and close it out at half the loss so we're analyzing as we go so stay tuned today we're going to pay a stranger's rent I'm guessing the rent can be 1,200 bucks how how much more or less do you guys pay for rent in this area would you guys say okay one second wait one second I'm sorry what see we always get something else I can help you guys out with yeah yeah yeah like here maybe help you guys out maybe thank you so much no guess you then I hope it can help out for you guys bye bye all right so we just got back home right now from the giving back to people and paying People's rent and I am a firm believer that whenever you give back you're going to receive every single time there's not one time when you give back to somebody or something that it's not going to come back to you but I've never seen it happen like today as soon as I gave back something was given back to me always happens but not like the day where it happened immediately so I just posted right now on my Instagram by the way if you guys don't check out my Instagram literally hundred thousands of you guys check out my stories every single day if you don't follow me you're missing out so I literally just posted right now that the trade has hit the alarm what does that say right there we are good s and forget do you guys remember earlier when I put the alarm on trading view what would happen if it were to hit that point you guys remember the account currently is sitting at $49 [ __ ] th000 showing you guys that when you give back you're going to receive always and it's just crazy it gives me Goose ons because we just did it right now in a natural format not even thought about it too much and look at this it's coming right back to us let me show you guys the charts so you guys can clearly see how earlier this morning price had pulled back into then retest this area of interest and the structure level and I had explained if price price continues to go up and hit this EMA we're going to be looking to get out because it can easily go into our stop loss but if price reaches and it breaks under this Wick we're pretty much good and we can continue to set and forget this position because it's going to then be creating a lower low and as of right now it is at $50,000 the highest the account has been so far we have turned $100 into $50,000 in front of you guys every single day and it's exactly what I explained on the 4H hour time frame if we were to have this humongous 4-Hour dogee we're going to fill that Wick it's just how it works you have to follow the set foret strategy so for now it is literally clear traffic from here to here this is the first takeprofit point that we have for a one to three risk to reward which if the account does get to there we can easily close at $70,000 now I know what you guys might be thinking but Alex close the trade there the profit for the week is 40k it's like sure you're right but this trade has so much more potential and you know what I'm accepting the risk if the trade were to reverse from here and go back into my entry I'm not going to give a [ __ ] because I accept the risk I am a firm believer that this trade has a lot more downside potential than just this move right here so you know what I'm going to do one more time one more time right here I don't think they're ready so we're going to [ __ ] set and forget we'll check back in later see you guys drum roll please drum roll please Market [ __ ] update 65 [ __ ] ah oh oh no oh there you go 65,000 [ __ ] dollars in profit on the account the highest we have been why because we set and forget set and forget now you guys can clearly see here on the trading view yesterday we were borderline [ __ ] we almost went straight into our drw down where I would have closed out the position and this trade would have went straight into profit yesterday we had a lower low and I'm like all right cool now we have a lower high this is a good spot to Stell new lower low now we're having a new lower high for a new potential lower low which in three [ __ ] minutes if it closes like this boys it's sails to the bottom sails to the bottom is that even a [ __ ] thing I guess it is now I guess it is now cuz we can make anything we want now we can I can make up a word called br all right so this Market is looking really [ __ ] good right now dude I would love for in the next 3 minutes for this Candlestick to body Candlestick close under this point right here so even on the 30 minute time frame we create a new lower low if we create a new lower low then this can pretty much be confirmed to continue to head to the downside but I might want to close the position right then and there because we are approaching this level of structure here and the price could have some type of reaction to then the upside but I do think overall we could continue heading to the downside I just can personally see this maybe having a little retracement and then moving down and honestly I don't want to be part of that I just want to get my profits and bounce so with the next 2 and 1 half minutes we're going to find out and in those two and a half minutes I'll just be updating you guys on these other markets so audusd we had the take profit pretty much hit perfectly where we were looking to enter this trade and then exit this position right around here so price had the move perfectly audjpy had the break how I was pretty much anticipating but now we're having the retest so now we can potentially enter position cuz you guys got to keep in mind dude it is literally Wednesday I can close out this position right now and I can still catch another position and turn the say CL at 65,000 I can still turn that to 120 this same week I don't have to but if there's great opportunity ities I'm going to do it so this is literally a perfect example of that this has had a beautiful daily body Candlestick closure under now we can have a quick lower high to then continue heading to the downside gbpnzd this this this this this John right here is loading up if this daily Candlestick closes as a dogee the next day is going to be a very strong move that's it done done it's just going to happen [ __ ] it done setting possible scenarios it's just going to happen because I said so that's just how [ __ ] Works nowadays USD JPY no jbp JPY has had the break now it's having a little [ __ ] retest so we're going to be waiting on that nzd JPY BR and then this one's BR so basically our only Market that we're looking at right now is USD JPY to see what we're about to do right now and the GBP nzd for a little break and retested and sell and the audjpy for a quick read this to S so usdjpy we got 30 seconds right now 33 let's just let's just do this together right let's have this countdown together so we have here $66,000 and let's go on the 30 minute time frame so we can see if it's going to close on you know what want to know what would suck so bad if right now that should just that would suck so bad all right come come on 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 two one oh [ __ ] oh my god oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] yo oh [ __ ] yo no yo yo I can't yo I can't make this up dude yo I can't make this up dude holy holy holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] bro yo stoping dude oh you 100,000 yo there's no way yo there's no way yo yo there's no there's no way oh I kind of hurt myself is my watch okay yeah it's fine doesn't matter we could buy another one oh oh oh dude oh yo we're about to be at 100,000 that's [ __ ] crazy yo the countdown is legendary yo no no no no we got to keep going we got to keep going got to keep going we got to keep going 95 95 oh 97 yo it's going to hit 100,000 yo it's going to hit 100,000 we got to keep going look dude I think I think we got into to like dude do we got up to there now now I just got to focus what is this on why did do this this right here shows you guys that the [ __ ] fundamentals will follow the technicals all right I got to focus dude market update boys market update boys and ladies and gentlemen we have officially officially closed the accounts at no no no drum roll please thank you very much we have officially closed at 90,000 [ __ ] dollars on the account now not going to lie we were a little bit impulsive I can't even lie I was literally looking at this and I was contemplating do I close do I hold do I hold do I close do I close do I hold and usually what happens when new Spike like that happens is it'll come into here and then it'll Wick it'll create a ginormous Wick and you know what I said [ __ ] that I don't want to you know risk that so I ended up closing the position somewhere around maybe right around here so if I would have literally just waited for the Candlestick to close I would have literally gotten a lot more profit because the price ended up going all the way down here if I would have kept a hole down there I would have easily easily gotten 106 $110,000 but you know what I am very content I am very I'm more than satisfied we doubled the goal for the week because the goal for the week was to turn 20 to 40 dude we turned 20 to 90 so the goal for next week we have just done it this [ __ ] week right now I was literally just telling you guys I if we close right now at 60,000 I can maybe turn it into 120 this week dude we just got so much closer to that goal right now if we would have closed that 40 or 50 like we're already there on this one week and it's only Wednesday it is literally Wednesday at 12:00 we still have a whole 2 and 1/2 days of good market movement so for now I'm going to continue to set and forget this trade and I'm going to stay interested on GBP nzd to continue sells to the downside break and retest to the downside audjpy is literally having the reaction exactly how I explained we're having the reaction from this level of support and resistance to another downside so I'm not going to chase this I'm just going to wait to see it gives me a better entry and the GBP JPY going to see if it gives me a better entry boys dude where make sure that thing's good you know boys all I can say is [ __ ] seven forget so now you guys may ask Alex what do you do after a day like this what do you do honestly nothing right you just it's just another boring day but today's a bit different coincidentally enough that we had a crazy trade like this this we're going to go look at new houses so I might move into a new house probably in the next month or two because I like moving every year paying more in rent because it just opens my mind more for forces me to make more money and um I don't know if to move to another house to a penthouse so come with us to go tour these different apartments and houses to see where we're going to go to we're actually late so let's go [Music] um I mean look at it dude literally I literally felt like I was in Scarface walking through this house bro they for sure assassinate somebody in this house no doubt and they for sure move drugs no doubt I mean you look like you do the same thing no I'm a Traer bro what what did you think look at it look at it I honestly s thought the same thing but we we're going to have to sacrifice a lot yo brother no parking house there's no parking I like my house right now like if I can put my house there perfect done [ __ ] how much does that one go for a month that one's going for $45,000 a month that's [ __ ] two times when we're paying on hours I know but like it's like the cheapest one in this whole island just not because I'm looking for the cheapest one is because there's just nothing other like there's nothing else available like look at this house you think somebody that owns this house is going to ever sell it no look at that he has a pond in front of his house like this guy's never going to sell that house like these guys hit the gold mine and then they just stick on it the people that buy the houses are rich they don't ever want to rent it out if I were to buy one of these houses I would never want to rent it out so the only ones that are still available are these little shitty ones right here look these little shitty ones are the only ones that are available you have to buy it demolish it and then construct it into something like this and there's literally only probably 15 20 homes in this whole entire Island left for that type of opportunity because they're all built up like this they're literally all already being demolished and they're all already fixing it up look there's workers 24/7 fixing them up there's rarely any ones available so right now we're going to go to the flat iron again to go view the biggest and craziest Penthouse in all of Miami going for $60,000 a month and then we're going to go to the brand new building Austin Martin we're going to go check out the third biggest unit in the whole entire building so I don't know we got to make a decision you're not first you're last second if you second place is the first loser always always remember that always and third place is The Biggest Loser in third place dude who remembers the guy in third place think about that some people might remember you in second but like ah he didn't get first like it goes way that way and then have the second floor and then the third floor rooftop 60,000 a month is [ __ ] crazy dude like it's it is but but but it isn't like d with the trade that you made today you [ __ ] basically pay for it yeah but trade almost say sof um cuz for me just it's burnt cash you get me it's literally money just being like GT3 RS never mind GT3 um it's just burnt dude like I'm literally just pixie dust Gone Forever 60k on that's like some that is like somebody that went to college studied for 4 years Works overtime that's their salary 60k a year and I'm just paying it on rent bro the disrespect uh towards money is crazy just shows you guys that money is not real it's not you just click a couple buttons and make that money it's not real you don't have to work for it you don't have to literally like do labor work to get that money back just use your [ __ ] brain now we're going to go see the Austin Martin which is that one right there so this unit is literally the newest and most prestiged unit in all of Miami right now the only thing I don't like is not as much of in the city it's like dude like if we're going to be in the city we're going to be in the city but I don't want to be half ass in the city they just sold the main Penthouse or the second main penthouse for 2 million the unit that you we were just at was a $20 million unit that's what they're selling at so they either sell it for 20 million or rent it for $60,000 and then here I come being like a dumbass and renting yeah I'll pay your mortgage here let's go I'll do it all right so Austin Martin sick amenities can't even lie definitely one of the best amenities I've ever seen I mean what would you expect it's a brand new building 2024 2025 but it literally looks like a JV version of the unit that we just saw I feel like such a [ __ ] if I were to get that and they're worth the same price one is worth well technically this one they're listing it for like 50,000 the other one 60 but you know I get the alexg negotiation like get [ __ ] done but no like my standards are so [ __ ] up after looking at that other unit bro like what do you think we just have to do the other unit bro three floors versus one floor mhm and it's literally the highest building in that area versus here on the other side of the yeah of the house we have like buildings yeah that's super cringe in my opinion and you walk in and the first thing you see is the master bedroom what the [ __ ] that that honestly didn't make sense yeah that was really weird sorry so sorry whoa didn't see you there how's my acting all right so I'm not mad but trade update I'm not mad but I would say emotions caught to me I'm going explain to you guys why so just to show you guys currently right now it is 8:00 at night so I just got back home about an hour ago from viewing the houses and Pen houses you guys can see the account is currently at 90,000 so we haven't obviously done anything since we closed it but look at the position look at this [ __ ] so the position was literally creating that big push to the downside to continue going to the downside so I close here on emotion because the market had obviously the big push at that moment and I was just seeing more numbers than I should have but I [ __ ] up because I literally was not practicing what I preach which is watch the charts not the numbers I was literally watching the numbers and I got lost because I saw something close to 100,000 like if that matters obviously it matters for the challenge but it doesn't matter for the charts so this chart whatever it's doing right here is going to directly reflect on The Meta Trader so if I would have just continued to set him for foret this position right now we would be up a 1 to6 risk reward where we pretty much closed out at let's just say 1 to 4 so we could have gotten an extra two risk to reward on this position meaning we could have been right now floating in profit about30 to $150,000 I'm not mad right I I don't care but I am acknowledging the fact that I did get emotional in that very moment I was super hyped and I was scared of losing the money and giving it back to the markets I can guarantee you if this would have been a regular position that I was taking outside of the challenge I would have probably continued to hold the position simply because the technicals still indicate that price is going to continue heading to the downside so I was emotionally invested into the position and the fact that I continue to hold throughout two days of it going from Break Even to then having the poten to go back is already strong now to hold after news fundamental like that I just I just couldn't handle it I just wanted to get my profits for the week and then done so that's also another reason I surpassed the go for the week I'm not I'm not greedy but I am acknowledging that I did get emotional and I'm not going to let that happen to me during now throughout the challenge because boys we're getting close it's feeling just like the it's feeling just like when I was reaching the 2300k on the last 100 to the mill [ __ ] starts coming up faster haters are not coming up faster talking [ __ ] making some [ __ ] up it's all it's all happening again it's like it's literally what I said when I turn $100 to2 200 no one cares when I turn 200 to 400 no one cares when I turn 4 no one cares oh but when I start making more money in one day that they made in their whole entire year oh now they're pissed off well boys you're about to get so mad cuz I'm going to do this I'm going to turn the [ __ ] $100 into a million whether you like it are not simple so this right here would have put us a bigger step forward into that challenge but sadly it has not because we closed the position out earlier which is fine it is still currently right now Wednesday so we still have Thursday and Friday so we still have two good days of the markets audusd is currently having a push to the upside which we're not really interested in it AUD JPY had the retest exactly how I anticipated and then had to push exactly how I anticipated which is you know not ideal we can potentially wait for another bigger pullback on The Daily to then enter the sell to the downside which would then create a 4-Hour double top retest of this area to then head to the downside GBP nzd is not having the shift the structure how we wanted it to so we simply are not interested in this trade USD JPY for me the trade is done I not interested in looking at this position anymore I don't want to add positions I don't want to scale in I don't want to add nothing the trade is done whenever I win a trade that's it I don't want to look at it I don't want to deal deal with it I don't want to get involved in it because any decision that I'm going to make on this trade right now will have some type of influence on me thinking that I can predict everything that this Market can do simply because I just caught a winning trade so when I win a trade as soon as it hits my takeprofit I like to stop looking at it I just don't want to trade anymore I want to find the same opportunity that I took on just a different Market it's kind of like when you take those other kind of Trades like once you take the trade and you hit take profit you bounce you don't stick around you don't keep watching dude you bounce and you don't ever take the same trade two times in one day never make that mistake G gentlemen and ladies fine you don't bro I could have been a comedian dud so when you take the trade and a hitch take profit you bounce you s and forget that [ __ ] you look for another trade so we're not interested in this tradeing anymore so now we move on to then gbpjpy where we are then waiting for this to come back and retest had the retest how I wanted to but we were obviously in USD JPY so we're not going to wait for a retest of here to then sell and then ND JPY same exact thing we've had the break now we're looking for the retest to then pretty much sell so oh and GBP CHF [ __ ] this I don't even care about it ladies and gentlemen it's been good day long day I'm not going to go hit the gy and then to see where the day takes us so s and forget so s and [Music] forget TR up trade up there no trades as of right no trades as right now remember that is the market when you see that you see the market when you take a loss you take it out on the market when you take a win you take it out in the market so get a figure in your office in your space and label it as the market so you can take care of it right now trade update we are currently up 850,000 no I'm kidding the day will come though when I do say a trade update just like that account right now is still currently at 90,000 but we will be up that amount soon trust me so as of right now we are currently looking at GBP nzd actually before that let's just take a second to admire the set and forget strategy playing out to Perfection by following the trend with the trade this trade if we would have continued to set and forget would have given us over a 1 to 7 ver to reward doubling our profit where we would have been at about $170,000 in the account but let's just pretend like that didn't even happen anymore let's go to now a new trading opportunity that we're interested in trading gbpnzd yesterday we had a retest of the neckline of The Head and Shoulders daily dogee and rejection from the Ma and round psychological level 21200 then here on the 4our we are currently now having a beautiful shift structure and the shift of structure is a clear higher high higher low higher high higher low higher high shift of structure you want to count this as the lower high blah blah blah we shifted you want to count this as the lower high it's still bearish but the one hour looks beautiful why well because we have a left head right shoulder retest from that neckline retest of round psychological level 2.200 and now the 30 minute is having that rejection engulfing Candlestick that we're looking for we have the shift the structure 15 minute is bullish 30 minute is still bearish this is not a bad trade at all to take right now like if I were to take this position it could be something like this my stop loss could be somewhere right around here for about 40 Pips and then my first take profit let's just say we label it at this area right here this can be a quick one to three risk reward now the only thing I don't like is that it is currently Thursday so since it's currently Thursday we basically have about we have less than 24 hours in this trade because this trade we take it right now we have to let all of the rest of New York session which is not much currently right now it is 11:40 in the morning it's a bit late so there's not much volume left in the markets we're pretty much betting on the London session of tonight and a little bit of the New York session tomorrow which truthfully if you just look at the weekly Candlestick you have to ask yourself what are the odds of this weekly Candlestick now having a wick rejection to the downside within the next 24 hours probably not that hot if you go to the Daily time frame you got to ask yourself what are the probabilities of this having the full rejection that we want in 24 hours probably not that high what this is probably going to create now is this daily dogee as well or maybe like another little red and guling Candlestick like this rejection the area and then the next day we'll have the pullback which this could be a trade that we could be very interested in taking come Monday or Sunday night so just taking a little bit over on the analysis on this Market these are all things that you know once you're an experienced Trader you just start looking into an all different types of angles and it just starts all making sense cuz at the end of the day you got to ask yourself yo what makes more sense to take it now or to take it Monday well why take it now why take it Monday you build a scenario like this and it almost just make sense right away so yeah I we'll update you guys on these markets right now it is 12:00 on Thursday today let's see where the day takes us so today so you got just the F right now we're going to get some gearing and get ready for bumper cars so today we have some special guests with our bumper car challenge we have Neil Jack DHI billionaire Barber we're about to get some helmets mouth pieces make sure the boys are protected which reminds me of the Super Bowl okay so if if you were to like potentially be like a collision of a vehicle which one would you want to wear probably that one okay black one on the bottom this one the black one on the bottom can you try it on let me see how it look on come on you know who I am yes bro I know you [ __ ] come on you're were to be like in a collision of a vehicle would you would you think this would work yes all right turny it on C pillow oh yeah D this might do the job try that on take a punch yeah don't miss oh hard don't miss I I can hit it hard though don't miss okay so just straight into the yeah I'm hit it super hard there you go really good like that's not going to do anything can you try hold thank you work yeah something won't get in your eye you got protection man it's better than no protection all right we take we need five we need five of them look at how you look dude I think I'm ready you're making a mark in history right now we don't need that the we don't Litter we don't we're good for the economy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [ __ ] the experience I I I'll take blame I was late the cars were whatever we're going to do it again but like double the size bigger we're going to have ramps and obstacles and [ __ ] D give us like 2 3 days notice so we can invite more people okay but you guys will pull up again you actually get in the car yes I'll do it next time I'll drive you got my word okay you got your and take off the [ __ ] airbags okay but you pull up again yes take the the windshield should Beed even the windows the windows is good I'm going take this mou I'm mold it I'm bring a helmet you bring it back and I'm crashing into your ass it we good catch me yeah well you know that's how I get hurt they do all that and then I throw one rock it bounces off I'll throw your arm yeah yeah I don't know if you know I never said that I could yo I I used to Fitch like a like a 90 yo watch out bro I don't want no wait watch out yo watch out watch out see that yeah I used to pitch a while ago oh that was a long shot that was nice all right let's see a left Lefty Lefty what the he's excited like we're in the danger zone head up out not front windshield what is that watch out watch [Applause] out don't be shoting [ __ ] out here dog that's a bad idea nigg said [ __ ] this [ __ ] ra ra ra ra oh [ __ ] [Music] [Laughter] you crashing the building bro out of gas where the [ __ ] did Norway go you can do the honors that's it I should break what the [ __ ] is that oh [ __ ] all right trade update so you guys can see here audusd currently had a ginormous push to the downside on oh [ __ ] Dam that would have sucked if you would have taken that position gbpnzd would have been a major major out look D I have the podcast right now GBP JPY no USD JPY bro if you would have continued to hold this position right here we would have literally literally probably turned these same $90,000 to about like $50 right now we're currently at $90,000 on the account and um actually let's go upstairs so I can give you the better trade up there right I can't I can't there's a surprice coming that's why what surprise is coming dude I don't know he's a little slow but he's not supposed to be slow this guy [Music] bro you're Savage dude bro you did it bro congrat [ __ ] dude he I was going to get a it bro when did you do it what the [ __ ] last week last week how the [ __ ] didn't I know dude what the [ __ ] no I was going to surpris you bro yeah look bro I was trying to get a 48 and then the down was like 90k so I was like [ __ ] that a [ __ ] that bro congrats bro yo you think you you could you could you could drift for sure don't bro that'd be gangster bro we got to do it you don't yo we got to do it 100% I'll help you worst case I just hold the Ste with yo congrats bro yeah bro stupid gangster shoot the Flames it shoots Flames yeah yeah like 900 horsep 8 900 horsepower [Music] [ __ ] God bro congratulations are the seats comfortable or no right yeah they actually really are bro yeah okay when I when I finish meeting right now I'll pull up on you let you finish this [ __ ] real quick and I'll pull up I see you D hey bye congrats [Music] bro God what a Savage bro what a Savage so this why want to do the trade update outside bro we never do trade updates outside so trade update huh sneaking [ __ ] huh that was uh sus I was like dude we do trade updates in the computer we don't do trade updates outside like no we have to I'm like okay now it makes sense by the way that's crazy because like Jordan can't even walk right now and the fact that he traded his R8 and you guys have seen Jordan he's been popping in and out throughout the whole entire series currently battling cancer and the fact that he cannot walk and he just bought himself a brand new 600 LT shows you guys that he's doing whatever he can to shift his mindset to getting better so he could drive the car he loves cars so he wants to drive drive the car now what is he going to do he's going to put himself in a situation where he has to force himself to get better so he can then drive the car so I don't know man I think that's like super inspirational and the [ __ ] that he's going through is ridiculous bro he's been battling this now for like two three years he's doing chemo now and stuff so about the Jordan we're going to pull up on him tonight maybe we get some clips of that if not we'll leave it for next week we got to introduce all the cars that I've gotten as well you know I don't think I've done a full-blown Bugatti intro on the car the new G wagon maner that I got got and I just added another thing to the addition and we got to incorporate Jordan we're going to incorporate Jordan next week 100% see if you can do donuts with the stick which would be super sick so with that being said trade update right so as you guys can see or as you guys just saw the account last left off at $90,000 it pisses me out just a little bit not a lot that we could have actually closed this trade and a lot more profit so this trade we closed out up here impulsively because of the move but if we would have simply continued to set and forget this trade throughout the whole entire week we would have ended off with a 1 to n risk to reward we would have literally closed at about $200,000 on this one position right here and you know it is what it is we hit the goal for the week can get greedy and I'm not I'm glad I didn't I didn't even see this happen because I would have just felt some type of weight but the experience let me get away from the charts get busy with other things so I could only focus on what matters and it's a different opportunity don't just get fomo and want to chase this trade So audusd currently on the market so taking it back to audusd we actually ended up having a reaction from the takeprofit point that we wanted to then price on the last 4 hours of Friday it ended up having a ginormous bearish Candlestick rejection left head right shoulder retest of the neckline retest of the EMA Fe move to the downside next week we're going to be interested in taking this trade continuously to the downside so we will will be on the lookout for that if you see it right now on the daily time frame beautiful left head right shoulder beautiful break of the neckline we're going to now wait for a retest to pretty much head to the downside and clearly you can see last time we were up at this resistance kind of created a little left head and shoulders then we had a ginormous push this is a way stronger formation in the same exact Zone we could expect the continuation pattern from here and the AUD JPY we ended up having to move exactly how we anticipated but we never got the retest how we wanted to even though we technically did we did have the break we did have the retest just wasn't as clean as I wanted to gbpnzd avoided this loss to Perfection due to what I explained um and even though it does look like this I this is a loss that I would have taken like I would have taken this loss probably consecutively for 2 years and I would always ask myself why am I losing why am I losing and it you know after you get punched in the face a bunch of times you have to realize to put your defense up or to kind of get out the way this is letting me know when to get out the way from the markets because it is simply not the right time to trade even though yes it does look good and if this were to happen on a Monday or Tuesday I'd take it all day but towards the end of the week I'm not going to take it because I just know that the odds of it playing out aren't as high as if it it be a Monday or a Tuesday but the only way you could actually get that is by experience so don't you know break your head or you know HTE yourself if you're making these mistakes I made them for a really long time now I just kept going and learning from it and avoiding it now so my win rate and my profitability is not because of how many winning trades I take it's because of how many losing trades just like this I avoid remember that so GBP nzd we'll update next week exactly what we're going to be interested in doing with it USD JPY we already explained it GBP JPY had the break and retest to sell and nzdjpy never really gave us the entry so every single one of these trades I literally share every single Sunday with my students I got on a live call with them where I'm sharing with them every single one of these trades where I'm looking to get in where I'm looking to get out why am I and why am I not I'm literally on a live call with you guys answering your questions and giving you the trades

here ask questions regarding the challenge we have the actual trading Community itself which is obviously fully private and then we have the success room where students are posting you know profits and withdraw look this guy why Cent Army is worth it um here you can see this is last week's profits he says he's learned a lot this guy makes he turned $2,000 into $99,000 with the trades that I

all if you guys click the link in description below join the community you're going to be able to see me live every single Sunday at access to my course get access to my community and my psychology

I Tried to Turn $90,000 Into $200,000 in 7 Days Trading Forex
Sep 15, 2024

I'm sorry that your Guru isn't honest and now that everyone's eyes are open he'll have to stop soon so one little mistake one little mistake and he got caught bro is Alex calling trades live yes is he flipping $100 into a million no he blew the account long ago the challenge won't go far he thrives on Deception right now the evidence stacked against you just doesn't look good good morning ladies and gentlemen as much as I would want to go right into the markets and show you my trades on this week where I'm going to be earning the $90,000 into 200 I have to spoon feed my children my very special unique children the haters come here come here [Music] airplane so as you guys know there has been an eight-part YouTube series where I've been turning $100 to $90,000 right now and there has been zero hate nobody has said absolutely anything but now finally the challenge is becoming big we're turning up big numbers so everything we've done to this point is absolutely legit but nobody has hated because of two reasons one everything is legit and two the thumbnail isn't that attractive oh Alex turned $100 into 200 it's fake ah no one cares about 200 bucks oh Alex faked the 200 into 10,000 ah it's fake oh but now Alex faked the whole entire thing now you got a video and thank you thank you very much Round of Applause please Round of Applause ladies and gentlemen thank you very much cuz now you just made me look so much more legit and I'm going to to now attack all of your argument points because you have now infected the mind of the other 2% of the people that were skeptical you're never going to infect the 96% of the people that have been following the challenge and know everything is legit so I'm sorry for those 98% of you guys that have been watching the series and are educated that I have to now waste 5 minutes of this video educating the 2% of re I can't use that word I want to say special people first one why don't you show the trade history why don't you huh I don't why don't you I know I know thought you were my Guru I know I know I know I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I had to pay my car bills I had to I had to [ __ ] they got me what this is the stupidest one ever all right as you guys can see right here I show the trade history once twice three times four times five times six times go do your research that I am literally showing the trade history in the whole entire challenge it's not my fault you want to be lazy and not go and watch these videos because they're too long I know you're special your attention span is low and you can't go watch an hour long video I'm sorry go go to the doctor and ask them for ader roll it it helps it might help you or meditate or do something don't call me a scav cuz you don't want to go through your own research which ties into the next point which is going to be why don't you show the withdraw with no traits so I'm going to tie both of these together right now so their alleged argument is that this screenshot is fake I [ __ ] up your Guru made a mistake while lying to you what a [ __ ] title huh 100 to the mill is a SK at M Alex lied to everyone at least you didn't call you scammer I know at least he didn't call him a scammer he's call me a SC ATM thank you buddy dude thanks man thank you bro well now you look like a re I can't use that word now you look special because I'm about to literally eat be you up so their whole argument is that I [ __ ] up in the telegram I uploaded this screenshot right here on August 25th and I posted a screenshot where on the monthly time frame I show the withdraw and there's no trade history and that's it they say the whole entire challenge is fake because of this like if I don't have a whole entire eight-part YouTube series video of me showing the before the during the after of every single one of my traits their whole argument is that I [ __ ] up and I showed the month and on the day as well and there's no trade history well let's get to the bottom of it so let's go right into it first things first is going to be the challenge and the history so let's go right into our trusty platform my effects book we're going to go right into the my effect book which by the way we have clearly shown multiple times throughout the whole entire challenge it's not like I'm showing this you right now for the first time which is what you guys would probably claim you guys can see right here how I started the challenge with a 100 $1 now let's go to the trades there's no trades the orders there's no orders the history oh drum roll please drum roll please all right so we are now here on the new edited fake history you guys can clearly see how I took $100 up until $22,000 add all this up do the math you special people and you guys can see right here the withdraw their alleged claim is that this screenshot is showing people that I withdrew fake money from a different account and that this is not real buddy what time does that say 18482 okay I click here 18482 what does it say right here 8 oh [ __ ] 1848 1848 822 822 how do we do that how do we fake that how do we do that cuz it's not fake it's real why is there a screen shot though right which is so first of all let's go straight into the first point which is why don't you show the trade history well clearly that right there is busted check that off and we'll just go right into the current account that we're in right now and then we'll show the trade history where we started off with $20,000 and then we took it up to $70,000 with these two trades if you haven't seen those trades make sure you go watch the last YouTube video that we just did thanks and you guys can see how it's all legit and then the next one is why does the withdraw show 1 month and no traits now this is the one where I actually don't have the [ __ ] answer to I would love to have the answer to it but I don't know why and I think I know what went wrong so let me show you an example so let's come here now to the metat trator 4 metat trator 5 right so whenever you log into metat Trader you can see how this bottom right thing right here is loading probably what I did is I had the history tab on the month or the day on metat trator 4 and when I opened the app it was loading and it was refreshing and I just happened to screenshot it at that very moment and it popped up with the month and then it went back to the DAT I don't have the reason why this is like this and I would love to go to medat trador 4 and show you guys that actual history of the month and the week and the day but the broker that I was using which you guys can see right here that it is a real account is disconnected they no longer have this server and I simply cannot go back and watch the history I would literally love to trust me but thankfully luckily literally luckily thank Lord Jes literally no no for real cuz if not I would literally have no explanation from this the whole entire Challenge on that metatrader account I had connected to the my effect book go look at the videos do your research look you guys can see right here literally the whole entire challenge I had on my history and luckily this right here is as well as right here you guys can see how the last update was on 8 22 they lost their license on 822 the same day that I have the withdraw withdraw is on 822 so this is literally going to answer both questions why don't you show the trade history clearly I do why does the widraw show one month with no trades I literally don't have the answer to this but this is their whole point of argument they said that I posted a screenshot on telegram oh which by the way if you're not in the telegram right now join like there's 169,000 Traders and over 100,000 people see every single one of the trades that I am sending in real time on this 100 to the mill series you guys are watching these trades late join the telegram and you can see the trades before anybody else say I'm literally sending signals in this free telegram please go join and if you join you might see me [ __ ] up again but this is literally the whole point of argument that the challenge is fake and that it blew the account because of this buddy it is literally mathematically impossible for me to blow the challenge based off of the trades that have I have been taking it's literally impossible question one or concern one or hate one busted why does a withdraw show one month in no trades busted now second why complain about the fees when you allegedly make 300K a day [ __ ] did I is that even spelled right alleged alleged hey Siri uhhuh how do you spell allegedly a l l e g e d l y had to fix it bu had to fix that if now they say oh no the guy I don't know a literate all right so why do you complain about the fees when you legally make $300,000 a day I did not complain about the fees buddies I complained about the slippage once again go do your due diligence I complained about the slippage on the account and the broker that I used to make 300K a day on was a very long time ago and they lost their man Trader 4 met Trader 5 license as well and they came out with this new web server and they came out with this new platform that I didn't like so I transferred to a new broker why oh cuz why don't you use the broker that you used before when you were making 300K and cuz I don't [ __ ] want to cuz they have a different platform and I don't like it I moved to a new one now and this new one that I have now I don't like it either and I'm currently transferring through and then this leads me to the next Point why which is follows up with this one why don't you share the link for the broker oh my God how many times do I have to say this I don't promote a broker if I was somebody else if I was any these haters trust me they would have taken the deal I literally got offered two weeks ago $600,000 a month to promote a broker in order to show people where I'm taking the challenge dude look how many of you guys are watching these videos over 100,000 of you guys within the two weeks imagine I put an affiliate link all 100,000 of you guys will go to that broker you know how much money I will make the broker and how much money I will make a lot more than this challenge I'll tell you that for sure and I'm not doing it to be transparent and show you guys that I make only money from Trad trading yeah do I have a info product where I teach people how to trade [ __ ] yeah I'm literally turning people into a profitable Trader where they're having their own 100 to the mill series you can see these students right here how they have literally taken the same trades as me in the hundreds of the mill series and even made more money than me all I had do is trade and teach people how to do the same thing I don't want broker affiliation I don't want any of this stuff as of right now and I don't share the link or don't show the broker for you guys to show you guys how legit and how transparent I am and I guarantee you none of these haters can say the same thing and they would never in my position first all they can't afford to be in my position respectfully and and they would not do the same thing so I wanted to clear up all these things oh I mean d so once again the whole point of this thing is show the history show the history show okay is that it is that really like ask for something else come on show like ask for my Social Security there I'll be like [ __ ] you know history clearly myth busted myth busted wait is this busted or is this plausible or a myth starting to look like a myth myth right whatever all right so here we clearly have the history on the hundreds of mil to this point then we have the current history you see how it's loading it's probably where I took the screenshot and it got uploaded this is currently right now where we are where we took 20,000 to 70,000 and we're now going to take this week 90,000 to 278,000 and for any of you guys out there that again want to have concerns with the challenge bro like dude you guys don't understand how much I take care of my reputation and you guys can see how there's more love than any hate dude look how many people watch me on a daily basis don't you think something would have popped up a long time ago this is my Instagram right who's this guy right here huh huh huh what you know about that son as you guys can see there is well over 130,000 people that watch my stories every single day I'm not going to let some little hater or some little wannabe want to take something out of proportion just for views because it's going to benefit their Channel and they're going to be able to make $50 more more this month because is a monetization sorry can't have let that happen because I'm literally showing you guys this as transparent and as legit as it gets and little tip of advice to the people out there that are or the 2% of people that are in that audience you never want to have an audience build off of hate that's not how you build the community trust me you want to build an audience off of showing back giving love and providing value not taking things out of context just so you get views because the person that you're talking about is bigger and just once again if this isn't enough I'm not about to spend the whole entire this series on this right here go watch the 100 to the mill series watch the before the during the after of these eight videos and then come back to me and have something to say until then so now that we have broken down and discussed every single one of these topics and clearly shown you guys that everything is legit let's get into the markets and have the actual trade update we're going to be pause was this oh I knew it the cars are rented [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] they're not going to have anything to say with this or like you know what the whole challenge to the mill series is legit but he blew the account now I attack that point the challenge of the M series is legit he didn't blow accounts but his cars are rented all right y make sure to hide the car rental company stuff all right you got it all right so we're here in the Bugatti let's just show my God like like if this information is not enough like if this information is not enough anybody can do that anybody anybody can fake that it's myam right but can you fake this are are you ready you ready to edit you you can fake it now okay how can you fake this registration to what company the one and only set and forgets LLC no no no but then the other cars are fake this is a ticket this car doesn't even have a registration [ __ ] see we caught him it doesn't say fxlg on it oh wait think you you added another crack onto that should I just break it right now ready I wa but the G wagon's fake how can Alice get in his hands on one to 25 in the world G wagon it's impossible dude it has to be fake one and only swing trading lab LLC haters please try again I don't want to oh no the be's fake yeah you know what the beo is fake yeah it's fake so with that being said oh no oh no the house is fake oh we got him he rent something all right bro I'm done with this [ __ ] let's go back now to do real trade updates and by the way this is my first ever response to a hater first and final response I just wanted to do it because I'm doing something legendary and don't want to have one small misconception this big get taking out of context for somebody else when I get views so first and final response never doing it ever again I get it you guys wanted attention you got it but now you look I want to use the word but I can't now you look unique and special and you just verified me and my challenge a lot more with that being said let's get into it TR for this week so we're going to start off the 100 to the mill Series this week with a starting balance of $90,000 as you guys can see right here and this $90,000 is now going to be where we're trying to take the $200,000 First Market we were interested in is gbpusd so we were waiting for a retest of this level of support and resistance and then sell but that has already happened basically missed this trade because we weren't interested in taking the trade at London session on Sunday GBP nzd is market number two we're waiting for a higher low retest of this level with retest structure EMA and round psychological level in order for us to take this trade to the upside looks like it already had the push to the upside that we wanted to without having the retest so we got to be on the lookout to see if it does come back here how it will look if we will be interested in taking this trade then we have audusd which has a beautiful one of the most beautiful left head right shoulders that I've seen in quite some time and we're going to now wait for a retest of this neckline of the head and shoulders in order to take this position to the downside it's already kind of having that break and retest and that sell but that's not quite what I'd want I want to have more of a actual retest and rejection from this point right here just going to make it look a lot cleaner USD JPY so this is the trade that we took last week once again bro it's funny cuz I I just love doing this uh we took this sell on USD JPY as you guys can see right here we have 9004 904 where you close out the position right here is where we made the money from this point to this point look at the market price and now this week we are looking to now enter a new added position on this potentially so as you guys can see this is here a very strong level of support support support resistance and support we're now going to be waiting for a retest rejection from this round psychological level 144,000 to then enter the cell to the downside looks like it Wicked into that area right now but too fast we got to wait for a better retest GBP JPY we were anticipating for price to have a retest of this level of support and resistance in order for us to then sell which we're still on our way there and waiting for that we have Euro AUD which we're waiting for a retest of this left head potential right shoulder which going to have a retest of this very strong level of support and resistance and a retest of the EMA to then head to the upside so we're just anticipating that pullback right now being very patient with it because I like this trade a lot then we have nzd CAD which has had the break exactly how I wanted to having the break now confirming the left head right shoulder we broken through the neckline we got to wait for this Candlestick to close the key word have to wait it's not a confirmation of The Head and Shoulders this Candlestick still has about 6 hours in it in order for it to actually move so this can have a ginormous Wick and then heading to the upside if in 6 hours it doesn't close how we wanted to so we have to wait for that as you can see on the 4 Hour we are clearly having a very cleaner Head and Shoulders we're now going to retest and head to the downside but key word have to wait for this daily time frame Candlestick to close it's not going to go up to my number one pair for the week next we have GBP CAD which we were looking for a break and retest to them bu which is not happening and then USD CHF not even interested in it so quite some markets this week uh what update just to go kind of everything is unfolding very fast now it's the beginning of the week let's see where this week can now takes us so if you guys had any concerns or the whole hate stuff is now cleared up please let me know in the comments I read a lot of your guys' comments and it helps me out let me know that you guys are enjoying what I'm doing and that it's actually helping and changing your guys' lives and you guys giving me that feedback means everything I'm putting in all the time in love to you guys you guys can get better into trading and you guys can hopefully potentially one day be like me which I definitely think if you show up every single day and you do what you got to do I think it's very possible I don't have any special skill I don't have any you know aeroterrestrial uh add-on like the only thing is I'm 68 it's the only thing if you're not 68 your odds are succeeding are a little bit harder but you know it's okay so but that being said said and forget and we'll update you in a bit but there's one question they still haven't answered demo trador what do you mean dude is the new account a demo account or Live account you didn't show that hey you think you you think you can run demo trator can't hide here we go again the [Music] airplane what is this guy what is this guy's name the guy that goes kab kab he goes by he goes simply by one interesting man he goes by I'm let you eat in peace for now quick trade update right now is going on we're going to go look at a new house right now we're still on the house tour mission so pick of the legend okay hey what's up guys you want to know what we started off the video saying like we started exposing how the trades are fake oh really yeah so can I see your Live account no can I can can I see your Live account on your traes all right so give me that that's a nice demo count is that is that demo sir no how do we know show us Liars oh [Music] [ __ ] all right so who has a better physique between him and I so he's got a little bit more chest development right you you have a little bit you actually have a lot of potential you have more of a a bigger back and a big so that's why you have a if when you lean out you'll have a really good V taper but he's a little bit leaner right now and has better chest back let me see the back no but don't don't scrunch it up you got to open it up you need help POS it he knows how to pose better I'll be honest okay so it's a it's it's it's a I don't want to say it's a tie it depends what you're looking for okay you can rest we can rest we can rest you have more potential because of your structure you have a bigger back right you are a little bit leaner so you can see the cuts a little better but you will have a better physique right now it's a different look that's hard to say right who has better eyes you do [Music] you all right ladies and gentlemen we are back in the office today was actually an interesting day we hit the gym went to go see a new house that's it I did grocery shopping oh y s the grocery sh thanks bro but with that being said trade update it is currently 11: in the afternoon Monday evening the account is currently exactly the same at $90,000 you guys are wondering why is my hand scratched up it's because I have a cat and I occasionally decid to into a fight with it and it's for of the fence is to bite scratch and that's the outcome of it so yeah right now trade update $90,000 no trade so let's look at the market so my new favorite Market is by far going to be nzdcad nzdcad has closed exactly how I wanted on The Daily time frame with the very strong daily body Candlestick closure under we now we're going to be waiting for a little pullback to then sell we can see here on the 4 Hour that we kind of did have that kind of a little ugly pullback but didn't make it quite all the way to even area of Interest one or area of Interest number two so we're going to wait for this pull back to then sell gbpusd we had to push to the downside how we anticipated the only way I can enter this trade is that we have a deer pull back to and cell technically the trade has already played out so missed this trade gbpnzd same exact thing it had the push without having to retested the area that we wanted it to technically missed this trade audusd currently daily retesting the neckline not how I wanted to I want a little bit of a deeper pullback so of right now this trade is not in my interest at all USD JPY in the other hand is having a solid pull back into this level of support supports and now potentially going to be used as resistance we're going to be waiting for the rejection of this EMA and this structure level and round psychological 14400 to then head to the downside so I'm going to set my alarm right at the top of this area right here and as you guys can see this is already working its way up from where we started at the beginning of the week so I'm going to put this pair to the top so now we have nzd CAD as number one USD JPY as number two next Market is GBP JPY we have had now the pullback Candlestick which is currently forming but as of right now it's still waiting for the pull back on it it's going to be my number third pair for the week so we take it from this spot we bump it up and now on audusd we already covered it Euro AUD we are still waiting for this pullback of this area to then buy just waiting on that and last but not least GBP CAD we were waiting for a r to set and buy not happening so our main focus is going to be GJ pullback for sales UJ pullback for sales and nzdcad pullback for sales that being said we're going to Now set forget good morning ladies and gentlemen it's it is currently 9:44 in the morning Tuesday morning so last night fell as sleep around 2: in the morning another usual night and we're back this morning with some interesting markets to trade so let me show you guys so nzd CAD exactly how I explained it yesterday we were anticipating for price to have the retest of this area and that is exactly what is happening right now when you go down to the lower time frames you can very clearly see that we are officially having our first clean rejection from this level of support and resistance and now when we go down to the 1 hour we can see that the 1 hour is creating indeed a potential shift of structure move even though indeed yes this is the lower high this is the lower low this is the shift of structure within the move let's check out the 30 minute time frame you can see the 30 minute time frame is doing the exact same thing in order for me to execute and enter this position I have to wait for a body Candlestick closure under this structure level right here soon as we get that then I'm going to be waiting for a little quick retest so we can take this trade to the downside or just a little quick engulfing on this position to then enter this trade I really really really like this trade does give me very clean cells to have a nice stop loss right around for 20 Pips and then my first take profit on this position as crazy as this my sound could even be this structure point right here I don't think it's going to make it to that level today cuz I I I think I don't think this one weekly Candlestick could make it that far I think within 2 weeks so maybe the take profit for this week could be the next even the next 4-Hour structure level is still all the way down there so maybe we can bump it up a little bit to this level of support and resistance right here for a quick one two three risk reward so stay tuned for that USD JPY on the other hand hasn't quite made it to the area of Interest how I wanted it to it's crazy because the alarm that I put yesterday at 143.5 41 has did not even hit look at that Wick barely made it up to that point right there like it was literally one pip away but we didn't make it not that I would have sold it would have hit that alarm but it would have notified me that it's getting closer to the area of Interest we got to wait for this trade to make it to the area of interest to be interested in taking this position right now this position at this point we would have loved for this Wick to look something like that that would have been a confirmed rejection of the area of interest but since we have not made it we don't have that confirmation and not interested in taking this TR trade just yet still waiting for the retest of this area so I can enter the trade to the downside next is GBP nzd looks like it is having the pullback indeed to retest the EMA retest the structure level retest round psychological level and it looks very clean on The Daily time frame love how it looks I believe that this can to have one red Candlestick here and then the next day could have the push so it could be like a trade maybe for Thursday and the 4 Hour looks a little bit weird because now this is the higher high and now we're bearish but it might have to go bearish with the daily to have the pullback and we have to see how it reacts once it gets to this point I'm going to put an alarm right around this area here so it can notify me once price gets there at 21218 GBP JPY still waiting on the retest of this level in order to be able to be interested in sells and gpusd not even interested in it it's gone so our main focus is on USD JPY to retest for sale nzdcad is borderline about to to enter so we're actively just waiting on this position to have the break and yeah that's trade up there right now accounts as you guys can see currently in the morning it is sitting at $90,000 same exact amount so we'll update you guys as the day goes all right guys trade update it is currently 10:04 p.m. so literally today we've done nothing it's been raining all day literally I've been home all day doing nothing so right now currently we have been anticipating for price to have a sell from the bottom of gbpnzd CAD what nzd CAD yes and nzd CAD we were waiting for our breaking ret from this area here and currently right now we are reacting from this area which is it is indeed where I'm looking to enter the trade but I would just love if it were to break and retest under this structure level here it would just look a lot cleaner if price were to have this so then we can sell daily time frame we ended up closing off with a solid daily bullish pullback Candlestick stayed under the structure level which is great now we can anticipate this Candlestick to then head to the downside it's not going to be a bad trade I can't even lie even if we were to execute it literally right now like if we execute this trade at this very Point have our stop loss right above this area for about we could we could even make it 20 Pips and our first take profet would be here still a solid 1 to four but you know what I rather wait for a little extra push confirmation then we can bring down our stock stop loss and then we get the same one to four like you don't have to enter the trade right at the top point and have this like this you can wait for a better confirmation that price has had to move and then you just lower your stop loss a little bit and you get the same risk to reward ratio literally nothing [ __ ] changes so for now I'm going to be waiting on this to give me a confirmation rejection from this area like another engulfing Candlestick or a solid break and retest to the downside next usdjpy this trade but imagine we would still been holding this position from over here all the way to this point a 1 to 11 risk to 1 to 10.5 risk to reward that'd be insane but price never pulled back to the area how he wanted to in order to enter the sell so the cell just kept going so this trade was another one that we have missed next we have gbpnzd which we are waiting for price to retest this area to then buy price has not made it there so there's nothing that we do then we have GBP JPY which we were waiting for price to retest this area to sell hasn't and gbpusd same exact thing breth this a sell it hasn't happened so it looks like right now our only solid trade opportunity that we have is literally just nzd CAD for sales so we're going to very much be on the lookout for this I'm going to put my alarm right under this 1H hour bullish engulfing Candlestick structure point which is going to be right around here so we have an alarm set up at 0.83 603 so we're going to do now is been a boring day it's been raining we're going to go do a campfire I'm feeling some s'mores and uh I don't know just want to go out on the G wagon do a campfire see if we [ __ ] get attacked by a Jaguar I'm going to take my I what should we go shoot this [ __ ] we never shot it before yeah we've never shot I don't know you didn't even know if he shoots you think it's safe to shoot this why not cuz I dude I don't know bro imagine you shoot it boom and blows up your hand imagine I lose my dude that would suck we I need this I only need one think about it to to place a trade yeah exactly but N I think we should play Same we're just [ __ ] take one of these Johns you know about that America America [Applause] [Music] [Music] you know a lot of people can look at me today and be like you know what he got lucky it was easy for him what people don't see is those endless nights of dark dark dark times of losing money every single day without knowing if I was going to succeed and the money the cars the Jets the watches all it's [ __ ] [ __ ] the skill set that I learned by myself in that dark room every single night showing up when things were bad when things got a little bit good and then bad again is what got me those things and you can take all those things away from me right now and the skill set that I've acquired will bring it right back it's not about the materialistic things that I have it's the knowledge and the experience that I've acquired over time that got me to the position that I am today and nobody could take that [ __ ] [ __ ] away from me you give me my money trade update ladies and gentlemen from R please ladies and gentlemen it is currently 11:15 in the morning and as of right now the account is currently sitting at a whopping you blew the account again it's like $15,000 now you know what let me just we're currently sitting at $115,000 now the reason why I'm not excited is because we could have literally been in this much profit we've been holding the last trade but sucks so we had to overexpose ourselves but it's okay why because the strategy is working once again nzdcad literally having left head right shoulder retest of the neckline exactly what I explained on the 1 hour time frame higher high higher low higher high once it breaks and retests this neckline we will be interested in selling and boys that is exactly what we did we broke and we retested once again like does not get any more legit than this oh but you want to know what's the crazy part that the downside potential of this trade is massive we can reach lows of all the way up to this structure point right here but we're not going to do that we're not going to be greedy we're going to be realistic and set real take profits and we enter this position once we body close under this right here we're pretty much good but you want to know what's the crazy part I'm not the only one that entered this trade sadly you guys are watching this after it already happened so you're probably wondering [ __ ] how can I make those trades as well it's very simple this exact same entry I well this exact same entry earlier this morning so right now it's 11:17 in the morning at 10: in the morning so about an hour and a half ago I asked if you're an nzdcad at everyone put a thumbs up in the message above and then post your entries 177 people confirmed that they entered this position and you can just scroll down here this is my private swing trading lab Community you can see all these people entering the same positions and adding their confluences you can see this guy right here adding all his entries like literally every single person showing the trade that they have ented this guy took 2,000 to 3,000 look at this right let's just pass by 100 different people that have legit entered the same position let's forget that this guy just turned 90 bucks into 150 not a big deal right this guy see I I like these right this guy's using risk management this guy's being responsible but there's one guy down here hold on let me find him where is he all right look let me see um one second one second where where is this guy it this guy no this guy's up like 10 grand one second where is this guy we have to go through is it this guy this oh no not this guy but it's just like this guy 90 bucks to 230 love it phenomenal is it this guy 100 bucks to 300 no it's not this guy where is he where is this dude come on this guy took like $5 to 200 I'm totally kidding dude these are all students just posting their entries bro one second where is it where is it where it right here here he is oh no wrong guy this guy $80 to $240 on the same nzd CAD CS then we have this guy that he took the AUD usds he made 500 this guy made 4.7k and I just told the students right now like bro thank you to every single one of you guys that took the nzd cad it confirms that my teachings are working and in fact you don't need trade signals to succeed all you need is the skill set and that motivates me to keep teaching cuz I get on a call every single week with my students and I try and literally pour out as much wisdom and knowledge as I possibly can on those one or two hours that I do with them and it just confirms you don't need signals you just need the skill set once you get the skill set the money will come so as of right now GBP no nzdcad is having a very clean momentum to the downside just waiting for Body candles to close around the here for to continue to hold the trade and it's going to be great and gbpnzd never retested so we never enter the trade USD JPY never retested so we never entered the trade so so far only one trade is needed nzdcad and I am I'm liking this price action so far I like how we did body Candlestick closure under that structure level now we can create a lower high and then a lower low so trade update we are up $117,000 all right what is going on guys trade update so right now it is currently 2:25 in the morning so I haven't done an update since earlier today today we pretty much just I don't even know I can't fall asleep right now it's 2:22 in the morning I'm literally looking at the markets like this right now so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go take a shower and I'm going to be watching every single tick because I cannot let this account below trade update we are now currently down $3,000 on the challenge so earlier there it is so earlier we were obviously up about $30,000 but we decided to set and forget as we should and now the trade is simply reversing back into the area where I expected it to pull back obviously you just never want that to happen but let me explain so you guys can see that we are about down about $3,000 and uh here in the markets daily time frame has had a very solid push to the downside very strong daily bearish and go from Candlestick but looks like the 4H hour after creating this new lower low in order for us to continue heading to the downside we have to create a lower high now this it's at the point where it could have the reaction from the support support support level to then actually sell which is actually great but it could actually make it all the way back up and retest uh and create a double top at this area which I don't think it will make it but I do think that it could head to the downside from this point right here you can also see it looks like it's creating another Head and Shoulders on the 1 hour time frame so we had a little head and shoulders to enter at this point right here left head right shoulder and now it looks like we're getting another left head right shoulder this is literally at the area where it's supposed to have the push to the downside not looking to add any entries just simply looking to set and forget this position and see where this trade takes us I'm going to be watching every single tick to see if it decides to break above um I don't know like if it breaks above this structure level right here I will probably be closing the position just because I think it could go all the way up into stop loss so I'll be updating you guys USD JPY never pulled back so we simply are waiting for that there GBP nzd pulled back to the area of interest but you guys have to keep in mind it is Thursday so not sure if I want to get into this position quite just yet but it did pull back so we are keeping our eye on it and then every single other Market we're just not quite interested in it anymore nzd CAD for now set and forget we are currently up nothing we're actually down $4,000 so stay tuned and keep in mind this sucks I don't want to be up right now but you know we got to do what we got to do I I'm telling you when I complete the challenge and I look back at all these recordings I'm going to be like damn that [ __ ] sucked but you know what it was worth it you set an example for everybody in the training na you set an example for people just around the world that you can really become a millionaire off just $100 with the right skill set and if I have to be that guy to be the first one to ever do it if I have to be that guy to go through these Lonely Nights if I have to be that guy to go through this pain I'll do it but best believe that if I have to go through all this to get it and you want it as well so will you don't think that I'm making this look easy this is not easy I woke up at 700 in the morning today and I probably will I'm probably going to do a 22-hour day probably fall asleep at 5: in the morning wake up again at 7 8:00 in the morning simple is it me or that thing [ __ ] move all right I'm going go take a shower all right so I just did an IG live right now 2:30 in the morning we got about and to add it to the whole Discord bro people are just [ __ ] like you know he would just go crazy in there and bro you know I'm I'm glad I have like a lot of you know guys like you in there that helped me out and you know I'm in there the the best that I could be you know to answer people's questions and [ __ ] sh but you know I I am going to add more weekly calls in there um I've been filtering out like the better students like like a Jane juice people like that where I've been uh telling them like yo you guys down to do like classes every day and just add more value so just the chat doesn't [ __ ] go crazy like that cuz bro it's and it's good though because bro you saw today how many people [ __ ] entered this trade earlier in the morning you know so it's just you know it's just a matter of like the cuz the people that that get anxious and just go crazy are the new guys right that they just got started and [ __ ] how long have you been trading bro I'm going to be honest with you I recently just got into this cuz I've I've been I've been the type of guy where I've you know I had my own company or I still have my own company and stuff like that so trading was never really like the one way for me to get out of it um like out of like the basic like day-to-day struggle or the Matrix is what people call it yeah yeah yeah so for me it was more of like a like a like a backup plan almost but I'm really starting to get into it bro and I stay up all [ __ ] night bro all the time I mean yeah that's that's how it is and then but but what you um like how long like a month two months three months like no no no so for in terms of like with your strategy bro probably within the last like six months I started very like like February March yeah you're still very very early on dude like you're [ __ ] just getting started bro so yeah that's crazy we just finished the live for about 15 20 minutes and 15,000 people tuned in to this [ __ ] live the community is literally crazy bro this is what I do it for I do this for you guys um tired 3 hours of sleep for nothing [ __ ] dude why is it going so fast dude look at this why is it going so fast [ __ ] trade update we're down about $166,000 on this trade [ __ ] man we literally stayed up for nothing last night so look yesterday we were literally at this point right here and we were're waiting for that 1 hour to engulf that 1 hour engulfed we are pretty much good right and we literally were we were good up until about 3: 4 in the morning that then the price decided to then started having a pullback this trade if I would have opened my eyes at 5: in the morning and seen this right here I would have bet my house that this would have been down here obviously we're wrong why because you can see how the structure rejected this level of support and resistance and then we went bearish you how we broke under that higher low so now this time frame went bearish I would have never expected I would have okay fine the pool pull back but if this body Candlestick closes above in the next 11 minutes we're [ __ ] we're [ __ ] so what I'm going to be is very strategic and I can predict these Market moves because I've seen this a million times so what I'm going to do is if I see this body holy [ __ ] man stop it stop it right now [ __ ] man [ __ ] bro relax chill chill what's going on dude we were friends chill relax there's no way all right so I'm going to make a decision in the next 8 minutes see what the [ __ ] I'm going to do with this USD JPY we never decided to pull back into this area of Interest how we wanted it to simply just waiting for it to get to that point gbpnzd we did that's so funny did the position we're dra down and then this position we literally predict the entry like look look how precise that is it does not get any more perfect or any more precise than having a pull back right to the area boom I obviously wasn't interested in it because I am in nzd CAD so for now just set and forget GBP JPY never made it back to the area of Interest GBP USD not interested just holy [ __ ] dude so this Thursday New York session we probably have dude I don't know when I look at it on the weekly time frame I love this for the weekly time frame I really do right so on the weekly time frame I look at it like this and I can see this Candlestick closing like that this week I agree I agree and what I could see is then the next week filling that chill relax dude do it slow man don't do it so fast all right so we're going to wait the next four or five minutes and then see what happens so sucks that don't forget I don't even know why I'm laughing at this point we do the account boys the 44,000 [ __ ] bro this is why we can't [ __ ] around talking [ __ ] we [ __ ] jinxed it talking [ __ ] so we just took a unnecessarily $40,000 loss on an ndd cab so look at this right here we had our stop loss originally set up at this level right here our stop loss was very strategically set right above this 1 hour lower high level right here let me take off all these junk lines that I have set up right here let me take this off remove this one and we had this stop loss set here for a very specific reason if price hits that point we are completely wrong we want nothing to do with the trade right that is what a stop loss is meant to do but when this body Candlestick closed I or as it was getting closing I'm like you know what it's a very very tight stop loss it's above this structure level maybe it can Wick up to this level so what did I do I moved my stop loss so that stop loss was here I decided to then you know what bucket price can actually make it up to the top of this Wick let me just move it up it can't it can't it like price can't hit that point right there just can't it's it's possible well then price kept heading to the upside and I'm actively looking at this on the 15 minute time frame and the 15-minute time frame I'm looking at all these little green candlesticks I'm like okay you know what first dogee it's going to just create another Wick and then head to the downside let me just give it some breathing room from this point right here cuz as you can see from this point right here there's literally about half a pip let me just give it about an extra six seven Pips so if it were to hit this high right here with this price action if it were a wick then price would head to the downside so now we have just moved the stop loss for the second [ __ ] time and I said you know what that's it we're gonna cut it at this point and I broke my trading rule if I would have just tooken the loss fine cool but I modified my stop loss I kept moving it up and up and up just because I was so invested into the position and I thought that it was going to go in my favor and guess what happened paid the [ __ ] price like an idiot so price clearly violated my stop loss by completely and now we were just completely wrong in the trade whereas if I would have closed out the position right here with about 20 Pips my loss would have been $20,000 versus at this point where it's $40,000 cuz I doubled my stop loss I went from a 20 pip stop loss to a 40 pip stop loss where I basically doubled my risk on the position that I had acquired for it daily time frame Clos with a disgusting absolutely disgusting bullish engulfing Candlestick which truthfully I am no longer interested in sells this week on nzdcad so that led us to have this loss for $44,000 [ __ ] do and the balance on the account is $44,000 not on the account so sucks what a waste because we were actually up $30,000 and this shows you guys that you can't let like your investment into the market just because I was awake last night up until 5:00 in the morning watching the market I went on an IG live with a bunch of Traders and explain to the trade like I was just so invested into it I'm like I can't be wrong I'm Alex G I'm the set for getet go how could I be wrong well this is what I needed a humbling moment to show me that I could be wrong [ __ ] just [ __ ] happens you don't [ __ ] you know don't can't predict every move so lesson learned and not going to happen again throughout the challenge I'm so glad I rised a lot less than we did because that we would have literally blown the account but this just sets us back so we're we were last week which sucks you know so I am out of my word and whenever [ __ ] [ __ ] I had to do that to the market I'm sorry the market it's always a [ __ ] Mark it's never my fault I'm not XG I'm the goat the S forget goat cuz it's never my fault but I still have to drive the beo [ __ ] so funny enough ironically enough tomorrow I have a jet trip to Dominican Republic to my tobacco farm I own a tobacco brand and I got to go make sure that the guys are making the tobacco good that the plants are good the leaves are dry and everything's being done well and I was planning to go in either my G wagon or my Bugatti to go get on my jet to then go to the tobacco farm so I have to pay 50k now to go to Dr and a jet and I have to put up on the beetle so right now we're going to go to the Hard Rock stadium because we're going to go film some ads for fan funed it's the number one Prop Room for sports betting so you don't have to bet with your own money anymore you could just pass a challenge and then they will fund you to sports bet it's the same thing as trading and as you know how be how I became profitable in the trading space CU I learned how to use risk management and use other people's money to make money and then I get a profit spit on it that's exactly what fan fund it is but for sports betting so we're going to go do some ads on it and uh hopefully we run into some cool people and we're going to try to potentially run on the field again you know we're not going to run on the field we're going to try and just touch the field we're going to [Music] try this looks like this looks like at the Super Bowl keep the streak alive keep streak alive hell yeah y be safe next time you streaking with us though I got is that all right this sucks this is why you want to follow your trading plan it's kind of ironic we're a $1,000 car on our way to a $10 million jet how does that even make sense I guarantee nobody's done this so changing shirts waiting for the guys to pull up for the podcast we're going to do a podcast right now on our way to the [Music] guys came all the way from London to L than to meet you my man how are you pleas we checked out that spot last night it was fire

good luck see see you later [Music] so fast forward like 10 seconds we're in our house right here in Dominic which we'll give you guys a little house tour after but look check this [ __ ] out we literally leave our house which you thought I thought it was going to be a big house here in the Dominican Republic and look at our front door neighbor yeah that's very humbling but look check how big of the chick like there's always a bigger boat but I'm never satisfied never I I never think it's enough picture how house picture how big this house can actually be you look at it from the side here so he has like an empty lot to the side look how far back the actual house goes so it's not like just a big front end it's a whole big side of it so right now trade update we ended off the week on a $44,000 loss so absolutely sucks we ended up losing more than we should have this week never fails bro Miami Puerto Rico and now dominan Republic we just broke the golf cart like how do we break a golf cart Cars part [Music] two can't break this all right drive [Music] it come on we got it we got it we got it [Applause] no no no all right this one super sick I like this one but I like more of like the old school Spanish H oh sh spe so keep for keep them you got to stand up so you don't hit your head we have this one up here we have one more this one super super sife look at the look at the garage and this you're looking at boys is your boy alex G's land right isn't that crazy from Dunkin Donuts to owning land in a completely different country that'd be nice I'm kidding you can't even buy land in this actual Community like you could only rent out because this whole entire Community is owned by one family it's probably one of the West neighborhoods in out of Latin America calleda the Campo Bad Bunny House houses here V diesel pretty much everybody so I I just want to show you guys got a little bit sidetracked we came here for the weekend because I own a tobacco brand and I actually bought into a company that wasn't a successful operating tobacco Strand and we bought into them their marketing was terrible and we're going to restructure Rebrand their whole entire marketing so hopefully some of the tobacco can make it into this video if not we'll implement it in the next one but basically we're going to come see how the factories see how every single step of the actual cigar gets made I don't know if you guys know but there's 425 hand steps in order to make one single cigar and each single cigar the one that I own takes 12 years to make so the actual cigar you're smoking for their plant to grow for the leaf to cure for it to dry for it to be the perfect temperature 12 years so this guy built that brand for I don't know 20 years ran it for five he was literally about to close down we're like you know what let's buy into it let's bring it back to life and we bring in marketing and make it better so we're here having the final like launch date that we're going to do of it I'm very excited but you know it's kind of what I do on my free time when I am not losing trades on the market and Argo next week is a turn 10 no Aro ouro next week on week 10 is oh [ __ ] Are we going to get run over that was suck to get right he went out on a middle of a road in the medican Republic so next week on week 10 we're going to try and turn these $40,000 back up to $90,000 every single one of my trades I share inside of my Discord with my students where I get on a live call with them every single Sunday where I give them the before the during the after if you guys want to know more about that just loin loin loin the link below loin it yeah you've been you've been out of America for one day you talk English yeah if you guys aren't part of the S foret Community you're missing out we're literally sharing all these trades even though we did lose this week Go I mean obviously if you're at this point you saw the whole video we literally predicted 80% of the markets this week we managed to only enter one simply because we're obviously entering higher risk trades if I were to be trading my own personal account I would enter every single Market because the opportunity is there but obviously since I'm ring 100% or almost 100% I have to be very selective on the actual trade that I'm doing so on a normal account you can make money every single week with these analysis that I'm doing all you have to do is join the set and forget Community oh siit poor oh wow look at GT3 that has by the way this is a third world country yeah this is a third world country to see a [ __ ] GT3 is ridiculous there's Lambos like they shows you that there's money in all these different countries they just lowkey so if you're not in the set and forget Community you're missing out see you guys next week and set and forget


============

I Turned $42,000 to $107,351 in 3 Days Trading Forex, but...
 Sep 22, 2024
 
 all right ladies and gentlemen good morning let's head to our office and let me show you the starting balance for this week on the account wrong phone right phone so right now the starting balance for this week is going to be $444,000 and obviously last week we had the unnecessary loss because we moved our stop loss and got greedy I don't know why I'm laughing at this point we blew the account boys the 44,000 so now let's get into the markets for this week now bear with me I'm usually bigger well I am usually bigger but I'm used to a bigger setup this a setup we're working with this week no AC and no monitor so please bear with me I'm going to try my best to show you guys what I usually see on a big screen so the first market for the week is going to be Euro AUD so Euro AUD as of right now on the daily time frame is creating a beautiful absolutely beautiful inverted Head and Shoulders left head right shoulder perfect retest from this level of supporting resistance perfect retest from that daily EMA perfect bullish engulfing everything that I would want to see on this trade 4H hour time frame we are having the reaction exactly how I would want to we have support resistance resistance resistance resistance resistance break retest then we have the EMA when you go down to the 1 hour we have a beautiful beautiful 1H hour higher low higher high pullback the only thing is I can't buy right now right under this area of interest only way I could buy is if we were to be like this above it so if we break and retest and give us that engulfing I would enter the trade I did not enter the trade here because as you can see at the time below this is on Friday of last week currently right now you can see that this is now Monday morning can never enter a trade on Friday you can only enter a trade at the beginning of the week never at the end of it so as of right now we're waiting for a quick little break and retest to enter this trade to the upside Euro AUD is my number one pair for the week next we have USD CAD which I'm interested in executing this position once and only we have a break and retest under the structure that I'm about to show you right now you can very clearly see right here on the weekly time frame that we currently have a very strong rejection from the EMA rejection from the level of support support resistance and resistance we have a lower low lower high and rejecting all that from right there when we go down to the 4-Hour time frame you can very clearly see that the 4-Hour time frame is indeed accumulating at this this area when you go to the 1 hour time frame you can see how it's created this very strong level of support and resistance here so basically what I'm waiting for in order for me to execute this position right here is going to be a very quick break and retest under this 1 hour time frame to then enter this position to the downside as right now it's doing the complete opposite so all we simply have to do is remain Patient next and technically last pair that I'm interested for the week this week we only have three markets usually we have anywhere from 5 to 6 but honestly the less the better because it's a lot easier to keep up with them and you don't have to constantly decide oh do I want this one do I want the other one no it's just one at a time so this one is going to be probably the next favorite one which is going to be Euro GBP Euro GBP on the weekly time frame we currently have a very strong higher low we're lower low lower high lower low higher high higher low very clean bullish rejection Candlestick daily time frame you can see how we are indeed rejecting this level of resistance resistance resistance support support which is good I need that to confirm that once we do break and retest above that it's going to then do what it did before break and retest and then head to the upside as of right now it's using it as resistance so we got to wait for the break and retest above the 4H hour time frame same exact thing you can clearly see how it is a very strong level of resistance all we're waiting for for this Market is for it to have a push retest and enter the trade to the upside it's a very significant level of support and resistance and this is exactly what we need in order to enter this position patients pays and then what that I'm a little bit iffy about I'm like whatever about it is GBP JPY GBP JPY very clearly on the weekly time frame we have a lower low all we're waiting for is on the weekly time frame for it to have a lower high retest that structure level and then we can enter this position to the downside so just waiting for a retest to then sell but as of right now my number one pair of me interested in entering a position is going to be Euro Au so I'm extremely tired it is currently right now 11:38 in the morning and we're literally about to hop on the jet G4 back to Miami came out here to check out my tobacco farm couldn't do any videos we're keeping it as private as exclusive as we possibly can and um it's quick 2-day trip 50 60k a jet [ __ ] it why not somebody has to do it Jet's there if I don't pay for it who is right [ __ ] with something so we're on our way back now to Miami and we have Police Court waiting for us so we can go back home and avoid all the traffic that we're about to catch when we get back home this is this is what making money is about it's about hacks like you think I want to pay 50 60,000 for a jet and then for when I land for me to go sit in traffic for an hour [ __ ] that I'll pay an extra can't disclose how much and I get a police escort from the airport to the house if I'm paying for the jet to save time but then I get off the Jet and then I waste the time that I saved in traffic I did nothing so what I'm going to do do is I'm going to get the escort so I can resave that time how do I resave that time with money money is not real but time is all right but actually before we leave literally the pilots are waiting for us on the jet it is literally right now 11:42 and don't ask me how but we brought this from the United States it ended up in my bag I don't know how this is my bag don't ask me but the people that have been serving us here at the house the ma and the Two Chefs they've been absolutely phenomenal and I always leave tip and I'm looking for tip and I'm like I'm I'm literally going through my wallet all I have is like a couple hundred buck I'm like I feel like such a [ __ ] cuz I usually tip a good amount and then I find this and I'm like oh this is it it's not that much it's like 1,500 bucks but I'm going to give him this in all the money cash that I have so I don't know I just want to see the reaction how they're going to [Laughter] reactos for oh my God funny like you can give somebody in the United States $10,000 like cash like a big stack like this and they'll be like thanks like they they won't give a [ __ ] you give lot of people out here2 $3,000 and you like look at these people bro they're like the most grateful people on the face of the Earth like look at them look at him look at them look I don't believe it bro I'm telling you Latin countries and other people that appreciate things way more than people in the US people in the US feel like they're entitled to it that's why I love coming back here and giving back more than I possibly can so really really great people [Music] all right so good thing trade is still not giving us the break and reach that we want to USD CAD still waiting for the rejection break and retest under and then Euro gvp still waiting for the break and retest so now en dra our [Music] [Applause] flight you guys about to see how we're about to catch no traffic right now on the way home all right so right now it is currently 4:07 it should take us about an hour and a half to get home from this private airport to the house let's see if this life happens oh my God I'm just playing with him now yeah I'm never on this side of this I'm usually always like in the front how to feel I feel like I'm pulling him over now oh my God L good evening ladies and gentlemen it is currently 10:3 in the afternoon afternoon afternoon look at that you know how FR I am 1:03 in the morning so if we did not take the private jet earlier or the police has we would have not been able to get half of the stuff we wanted to get done to get it done currently right now the account is at 44,000 still no trade in the accounts because the market simply hasn't given us an opportunity so let's see what the market has done so Euro AUD we've been anticipating for price to have a breaking retest of this area to head to the upside we have clearly not had that break and retest to head to the upside simply waiting for break retest to then buy USD CAD same exact thing we are waiting for price to break retest to then sell daily time frame closed with a daily dogee which is great CU confirming that it's accumulating and rejecting at this area here so we're simply waiting for that to happen waiting for the break and retest to then sell Euro AUD back at it real quick the daily time frame didn't close super bad it's decent I anticipate for this next daily Candlestick to have a daily bullish engulfing and then the next day we'll have a pullback then head to the upside so this might be a trade for Wednesday night lastly is going to be Euro gvp so we did have a big red day but we are pulling back up to this level of support here which is clearly support and resistance where we could have a reaction from but not interested in doing anything down here until we don't break and retest above so basically we're waiting for one break and retest two break and retest and three break and retest a little interested in GJ if it does manage to make it all the way back into this area we are kind of already on our way there but I'm not going to be interested until we don't actually pull up to this level of support and resistance so have to be very patient and be on the lookout for this Market to give us that opportunity once we are there so not much other else to do other than instead of forget I'll see you guys in the morning all right ladies and gentlemen trade update it is currently 3 in the afteron afternoon so no action in the accounts but we will have action tonight tonight we will enter battle once again tonight we're going to enter battle and take these $44,000 to $100,000 tonight and you know what to go enter battle tonight I need a new watch cuz I don't I don't know I don't I got tired of my whole entire fet of watches you know what let me go buy a new watch today [ __ ] it somebody's got to do it right so we're going to go buy watch for tonight's battle so this is I'm going to show you guys how when you raise your status and your mind and who you want to become by let's say getting a watch or a car how the money is going to come right back we're going to test this live today I'm going to go buy a new Richard Mill right now and as I buy it I'm going to make that money back tonight because I've just opened my mind to new things or I could be totally wrong and I can buy the watch and lose the money tonight and I [ __ ] look like an idiot but I highly doubt that's going to happen so trade update right now update on your VP we're having a daily bullish engulfing Candlestick exactly what we've needed this why I'm saying we're going to have a battle tonight because this Market is currently having the break that we wanted now we're going to wait for the retest in order to enter this trade to the upside obviously we can't enter a trade now because it is not the right session to trade GJ has pulled back to the area of Interest exactly how I wanted to we had the wick of the round psychological level 18700 rejection from the 4our EMA and then 1 hour price action is perfect so it's our second battle we can potentially enter tonight and then lastly is going to be USD CAD where we are currently having rejections from up here and the daily time frame is having a daily dogee Candlestick Euro AUD currently we're waiting for the break and then the retest for price then head to the upside so USD CAD break and retest Euro AUD break and retest this one we're looking to enter very soon GJ and then Euro GBP we're looking to enter very soon tonight we will be going to battle so armor up with me we can beat the market it's pretty good right it's a pretty good uh no no super cringe but before that we need a new watch so let's go get the the rich meal I bet that's not cringe [ __ ] it makes it less cringe okay exactly that looks crazy I forgot you have this watch yeah bro I love it insane I wear this watch more than like anything honestly cuz it's like subtle and

to trading and you're going to tell me what trade I'm going to take right now all right how old are you 15 15 get him all right so I'm so I'm 6'4 all right I don't know how tall are you 63 no no no if I'm 6'4 you can't be taller than me so I'm 6'4 you have to be like 69ine all right does that make sense all right all right take a seat come on come here sit down all right so we're going to do a trade update so he's been trading he's been following the series for how long we've been following the whole trading stuff six months six months have you made any money trading or no a little bit how much is a little bit I like 1,000 1,000 yeah okay so we're about to risk tonight $444,000 so trade update what time is it right here on this phone what time does it say 9:06 p.m. 9:06 so it's 9:06 how much money do we have in the trading account right now 44,6 to and 7 what's the most amount of money you've risk in one trade like 1,000 okay so we're about to risk 44,000 on this trade [ __ ] up it's your ass all right all right okay so first one is the Euro GBP so eurogbp we've been waiting all day for it to have the break have the retest and as of right now we're about to be interested in executing this position we're having the retest exactly how I wanted it to when you go down to the 1 hour it's having the bullish engulfing exactly how I wanted to and when you go down to the 30 minute it's having well the 15 minute it's having the shift of structure exactly how I wanted to what would you do would you take this trade right now or not no why why I don't like it why don't you like it tell me tell me why oh no this is not going to be good all right let's go to another market right so if we don't like one market we can go to a different one GJ right GJ we had the retest exactly how I wanted it to this area of Interest daily time frame did close a little strong to that area I don't like that and it closed above 18700 let me just put this at the round psychological level 8700 and when you go down to the 4 Hour the 4 Hour went very much bullish and we're above the EMA and we're above the structure level not good right do you like this one or no no why not the EMA is 29 oh the EMA okay all right all right then we have Euro AUD which we're waiting for this break and retest never happen then we have USD CAD which we're waiting for this break and retest hasn't happened all right this is the one this is the one all right yeah this the one all right so you're going to take the trade right now sweating all right ready all right go I want to do it bro why just just risk 100% it's not a big deal risk 100% is insane you know you're going to risk the whole 44,000 so so if if the trade loses I don't cuz I know you give me the money back so I don't really give a [ __ ] I'm kidding all right so this trade we might execute it very very soon we might execute it within the next 30 minutes to 45 minutes um because what I want to wait for is a little bit more price action I want to see how this trade reacts once it retests this level like this trade is literally about to take off like if this Candlestick goes right back above this one I'm going to probably execute this trade immediately it's actually a very small stop loss like I'll probably even make the stop loss longer I make it 15 Pips because it is a very very small stop loss and I see very very very great upside potential on this market so I I can see this trade going from here easily all the way up to this point right here for a 1 to three risk to reward um I don't see any friction on The Daily time frame other than like this structure point right here but even if price where to then stop at that point that's still a 1 to2 it's currently Tuesday night so we still have Tuesday nights Wednesday morning Wednesday night Thursday morning and Thursday night so we still have like a solid four more sessions left which I think there's enough momentum to get to that point right there and I don't see any friction on the 4our for this trade unless it's somewhere around here but then at that point we'll already re be up a solid amount so yeah we'll update back in like the next like 15 20 minutes I just want to see if price can break like if price can just break above this area again here just even start wicking above it yeah that's going to be my indication that this is a higher low and then it's going to start creating a higher high to head to the upside right it all right thanks for nothing all right ladies and gentlemen trade update is currently 2:30 in the morning and no trade has been taken we actually avoided this loss or Draw that right now but let me show you let me show you my cousin bro this guy this guy can't hang dud look at this guy that's how he wants to be a profitable Trader this generation this the perfect example of patience pace so we avoided this massive 30 minute draw down or 1 hour Candlestick I was ready to execute this position literally as soon as this Candlestick closes that morning star formation but I always wait my 15 to 30 seconds to execute the position and would you look at that price decided to have a push to the downside so avoided this loss perfectly and this just Pro you once again it is 2:32 in the morning so this is why I like trading London session because volume kicks in obviously this volume just happened to kick in the wrong way this should have happened to the upside which should have been beautiful so no I'm not looking to enter this trade right now because oh Alex but you're going to get a better entry it's like no dude that's not how this works bro like the trade if it was my it meets my strategy it's supposed to go up from here not down from here this does not mean I get a better entry so right now I'm not fully interested in it and until we don't get a better rejection to the upside then we have GBP JPY where we are currently waiting for this price to have a clean pull back into here and then have our rejection to the downside which we currently are having that pullback so I and then wait for an engulfing around this area to potentially enter this Market I'm going to be on the lookout for this one even though it doesn't look the cleanest Euro AUD no break and retest above and USD CAD still waiting for the break and retest on there so for right now no trades cousin knocked out 2:30 in the morning and I'll probably be oh [ __ ] all right ladies and gentlemen good morning look who decided to finally wake up good morning guys so currently right now it is 12: in the morning or afternoon yeah in the afternoon still no trade update so as you guys can see the account is still at $44,000 and the trade from last night if we would have actually executed it we would have taken a massive loss you wouldn't know cuz you fell asleep yes sir why' you fall asleep a lot of work this guy can't hang this generation can't hang look at this guy all right bro bro you keep falling for bro bro all right so right here basically we were waiting for a retest to then head to the upside that did not happen so we simply did not execute this trade now we are having a reaction from this level of support because it is a very strong respected level of support support support resistance support and support so we might buy here very soon as crazy as it seems even though the 4H hour time time frame is bearish I'm just going to be on the lookout for some potential entries on this trade I'm going to be waiting for something like a little break and retest to then buy this trade to the upside and it's still in my interest GJ yesterday we avoided a loss so on this pullback right here we never got our engulfing Candlestick to the ENT of the trade to the downside so we avoided this loss to Perfection price simply continued heading to the upside basically we were waiting for the pullback here to then sell then did not have that pullback did not have the rejection we wanted to avoid this loss I'm still interested in the sells just not yet like I think this daily time frame has to close like that then the next day could be the push as you guys can tell it's Wednesday we basically have the rest of tonight tomorrow morning so we basically have three more sessions left in this week for the market to like give us opportunities to make money so GJ might be one of those markets that can potentially make us money then we have Euro AUD which we're still waiting for this break and retest above which looking at it on the daily if the daily time frame closes like this I'll probably enter the position down here which would still be an ideal buy even though the 4our time frame is bearish I'll probably wait for a little bit a body close Above This lower high structure point so I can take it straight to the upside so a little break and retest above that to then enter that buy or we have USD CAD which we might just enter the sell at a rejection from up here and not wait for that break and retest we got to we got to see all the trades right now are still lining up there's still plenty of opportunities we just have to be very patient I like this one right here USD Cad and I like Euro AUD for breaking R this buys GJ F and then Euro GBP F so we'll check back in in about an hour or two hey what's going on brother my bad I know I'm blowing you up no it's okay no bad news is what they said the two to three weeks out so look I'm I'm cumin brother right like we we find a solution to [ __ ] everything yeah could we just get it done [ __ ] man what a [ __ ] mission stupid Bugatti bro just pisses me off cuz I want to [ __ ] drive my car dude pay 50k a month for it and I can't cuz it's stupid belt dude like and it's annoying because Bugatti [ __ ] you don't assuming [ __ ] man it's just a belt why do we have to go to Bugatti and do everything at Bugatti and wait 3 weeks for the parts that come from Paris we'll figure it out watch I'll put I'll put my [ __ ] Gucci belt on that [ __ ] bro get out of here trade update man I'm pissed off now USD CAD we have had a ginormous Wick happen towards the last hours of the day very very interesting daily time frame has closed with a humongous daily doe Candlestick this will fill today it's going to fill this Candlestick tonight we have Wednesday London session as a battle coming very soon then we have Thursday New York and Thursday London this is loading we're going to be entering this trade very very soon next we have Euro GBP which we avoided this loss last night we might be entering new positions at this point here but I don't want to buy against this ginormous daily bearish engulfing candas they clearly were in a consolidation I was going to buy once we broke and retested out of this consolidation to the upside and then on GBP JPY we were going to be interested in taking a sell once we had a break and retest of this trade to then head to the downside so we're still waiting for this break and retest to then sell and then we are still waiting for this trade right here to have the breaking reaches above this one probably won't happen anytime soon because we've had the strong daily dogee so well actually you know what I actually like Euro AUD a lot because this daily dogee still makes this daily structure move bullish this is the higher low this is the higher high and basically all I want is a little quick break and retest above that EMA and this level of support to enter this trade to the upside I would love for the 4 Hour to go bullish when I enter this trade so we have to break Above This lower high for price to then continue heading to the upside so we are technically right now in this bearish cycle 1 hour channel on the 1 hour you guys know I hate these channels not a big fan of them I just want a little quick break and read this out of this to then head to the upside so you know what I'm going to actually put this one as my number one and then I'm going to put USD CAD as my number two so right now we have Euro AUD as my number one break and retest for buys then we have USD CAD for my number two we're waiting for breaking retest for sales which I don't even know if we'll wait for the retest of it like we might just enter o no this is a little bit tricky can't even lie yeah we're just going to keep our eye on it I'm very interested in entering this very very soon and then Euro GBP not interested GBP JPY I have it so I'm moving it out for my fourth pair to now my third pair of the order of the markets that I'm actively interested in so breaking retest to then sell and then we have nzd CAD not looking and GBP CAD not looking all right SI so it's been a boring day been here all day probably going to take a nap maybe hit the gym we know we got to get fit and then see where the day takes us stay tuned all right ladies and gentlemen trade update is 11:35 at night you can see right now still no trades and history still basically nothing I'm getting ready for battle tonight so we have literally tonight London session tomorrow New York session and then Thursday night London session we got three 8 hour sessions left in order for us to turn these $44,000 into $100,000 so I'm about to do some degenerate [ __ ] I got to do it I got to do it I'm going to break my trading plan sadly I'm going to make money gladly and then I got to drive the beetle back to sadly but then I hit the go for the week gladly you see is the math mathing you get it makes sense makees sense okay trade update so right now Euro AUD currently we were waiting for a break and retest above here to take the trade to the upside no break and retest no trade perfect loss avoided by simply remaining patient so this is the exact trade that I was waiting for and it didn't happen USD CAD we're looking to enter this trade this is why we got to be patient earli we were interested in potentially taking it but we're waiting for the break and retest still very much interested in it especially after this ginormous liquidity pool Wick out whatever you want to call it this is the perfect type of trade that I'm looking to enter tonight if that has a shift of structure under this level right here that closes under that in the next 20 2 minutes as you can see right here I will then be interested in executing this position right around here so I'm very much interested in this very position next GBP JPY um had the exact same push to the upside so we were anticipating for price to reject here but we had a crazy run to the upside to now retest this higher level of structure I still believe that we could continue heading to the downside I just think it's going to take a little bit more time so being very patient on it Euro GBP keeping my eye on it because we might enter on the break and retest of this so right now if I were to base it all off of the top priority it would definitely be USD CAD number one Euro GBP p number two and GBP JPY number three so you guys are seeing how throughout the week like it changes like my number one pair for the week is not my number one pair on Tuesday or Wednesday that's why I picked top four top five the markets that I'm going to be interested in trading for the week and then from there as the week goes as the market starts unfolding I modify base whatever is going to give me the highest probability trade setup so for right now 11:38 in the evening no trades right now I'm going to go take a shower and get ready for battle tonight because we're we're doing it we're going to do it tonight yep morning ladies and gentlemen um it was a brutal night last night in and out of sleep all night and um yeah this morning we thought we were on to something by adding another position and we weren't so as of right now we are currently in a position that we are going to continue to S and forget I mean I literally just called it last night it's not my first time calling it all right boys so market update we are currently up 41,000 so we're back at we're not even back where we were last week and we just did the dumbest thing ever we just executed a loss right here because we decided to enter this position right around this area thinking that I was just going to continue to go down like when you don't sleep all night you just start seeing [ __ ] but then I go down to the 1 hour I'm like but wait this price definitely has the opportunity to come back and retest this level of support and resistance just how it did here it could even go up further it could literally go back up all the way up to this area right around here before actually going down so the 80 lot that I took at that point right there I simply closed it cuz it was actually [ __ ] so now I currently in this position um it's literally what I said yesterday we're ready to execute it we're just waiting for the right confirmations we just got the break of the structure how I wanted to enter the EMA and yeah we're in this position now so I'm just going to anticipate for price to continue having a push to the downside after this retest uh we avoided a loss yesterday on Euro GBP avoided a loss on GBP JPY and avoided a loss on Euro AUD so we've been dodging bullets all week finally managed to catch one that aligns with the strategy so as of right now I am probably going to take a nap for an hour and I will keep you guys updated so this is currently 800 in the morning trade update and let's see where it is I think New York session should come in and help it out uh you know I'm going to actually put an alarm so yeah I'm going to actually put an alarm right around on top of this area of interest and the EMA and that alarm I'm going to label it as going to come here edit and I'm going to label it adds not good and then we just save it and now we set and forgot all right market update not good this is so annoying [ __ ] man because like lose sleep for nothing and it's so pointless bro look at this like what I'm about to show you right now is going to literally show you New York session and leond session having the exact same [ __ ] move [ __ ] all right so you guys can see here we are currently down 42,000 I mean never mind we're back at $42,000 on the balance of the account trade pulled back higher than I expected you guys can see here how literally London session is the same as New York session this move with this move this move with this move this one with this one and these two are [ __ ] exactly the same so London New York this is crazy dude so annoying but I just hate I mean it felt the Wake exactly how I said it was going to do it but I just hated using to sleep man because I could have just gone to sleep normal and just woken up right now at 9:48 in the morning and entered the trade and then we're good I got a full night's Worth to sleep not emotionally drained not physically nothing or whatever we're going to be watching this trade so we're going to continue to set and forget for now might close soon might not can't continue to lose using on this account so I'll update you guys exactly what we're going to do I don't see any other opportunities in the market that I'm interested in just yet EUR gvp nothing gvp JPY nothing and Euro Au nothing we update you guys on what we do right now we're down about $4,000 and uh yeah stay tuned I might just take a nap and not even make a emotional decision on this and just wait for the technicals to do its thing we'll update you guys all right guys trade update I feel like I just did an impulsive decision not happy about it let me just show you guys so basically we just closed out the positions at break even right about another $2,000 loss so trade was pulling back into this area here I did not like the price action on the 15minute and um I literally closed on the top of that wig being created I said [ __ ] that I'm going to get out of here I don't want to be part of it cuz I think because this bullish Eng golfing it's going to go up but I let a 15minute bullish engulfing Candlestick dictate that it is stronger than this area of interest that is stronger than this level of support that's not going to be used as resistance I let that be stronger than the trend whatever bro I'm like tired I want to get some rest I'm going to probably be entering the position soon till we get a nice little engulfing I'm going to definitely risk a lot more and we're going to get a much bigger trade so stay tuned for that decided to cover my end I didn't want to blow it on this position here because uh I don't know man just lack of sleep lack of everything you start seeing stuff so for now the account is currently sitting at 41,000 all right boys today is a primal example of a primal human being when you get up every single day and you go to battle you fight you fight fight and fight and fight now you might get knocked down but you get back up and as soon as you get up you get knocked down again but you continue to fight and today is one of those examples where I got knocked down oh I got knocked out bad but I kept fighting trade updates currently up $62,000 we fight we continue continue to fight and never stop we closed the position at the top of this Wick up here and literally we probably did the best decision we could have done we closed these two positions at a $2,000 loss for a total of60 Lots then we waited for price to have its rejection now some of you guys would have been like wow you closed for no reason you could have still been holding the trade you know what you're right you're right dude but you wouldn't be up $63,000 if I did not do that why because I waited for this next entry bearish engulfing confirmation uh Evening Star formation under the EMA rejection from the structure and I said you know what okay fine you want to take me out of break even and you want to make me lose an extra 15 Pips from the original entry that I originally had up here from this to this point okay fine I'll make it back by risking 170 more Lots on this position before we had 160 Lots which was these positions right here 880 + 80 is 160 you add all these up and we have 330 so we essentially almost doubled a little bit over the risk that we had before but we got an extra confirmation that we did not get here and you know what I [ __ ] with it because yeah we lose 15 pits from the entry but we gain 170 Lots it sucks on the short term but on the long term trust me it's going to pay off man dude how stressful dude these last couple of hours basically we entered this trade as soon as it engulfed right after this 30 minute engulfing confirmation we literally got stopped out at break even because of I don't even I don't I don't even I don't even know what to say dude I love this 4our Candlestick that just closed literally 30 minutes ago I love how the 2hour time frame closed as well with this 2hour bearish and engulfing Candlestick what I'm going to be doing now is I'm going to basically hide this trade cuz technically it didn't even happen and we're going to only focus on this one beautiful 1 hour continuation beautiful 30 minute look guys all we need for this to be a big time home run is going to be a body Candlestick closure under this right here if the 30 minute closes under this structure point right there if the 1 hour closes under that structure point right there if the 2 hour closes under that structure point and the 4H hour closes under that structure Point boys we are golden that's all I got to say so for now it's 1:31 in the afternoon we're about $65,000 and we're going to continue to hold this position not interested in any other Market that is not USD CAD right now Euro GBP I'm good GBP JPY I'm good Euro AUD I am good usdcad oh no dude come on I dare you I dare you I dare you that's all I got to say good morning ladies and gentlemen well it's supposed to be good evening or good night ladies and gentlemen but it is currently 2:06 in the morning this has turned into my new morning this is where I basically wake up and start my day because I am clearly not going to sleep at anytime soon because this challenge as you guys can see in these last two days have just been trade updates the whole entire time usually we go take you along with me wherever we go either to the gym to the bank um to go do whatever yeah we haven't really been doing anything these last two days simply because we have just been doing trade updates my sleep schedule is bucked why because we are not blowing this challenge we are going to turn these $40,000 into $100,000 now you may ask yourself but Alex you were up 111 already why don't you close it the takeprofit for the week because we're not [ __ ] we continue to set and forget the trade and this trade has a potential to be a quarter million doll trade right now we are up $50,000 with a balance of $91,000 as you guys can see same exact account trade history everything the same this trade has the potential to be A4 million so let me show you guys right here so earlier we were obviously ipating for price to have a body Candlestick closure under this level and if we did we were golden but price is having it pull back to now retest this level of support support support and then resistance through here to head to the downside so fair game not mad at it but literally the moment we body Candlestick close under this structure level we're good we are home run but a big but if this movement happens to the upside and we body Candlestick close above this structure point we're [ __ ] we are Mega [ __ ] so right now we are literally in the middle of that decision making are we [ __ ] or are we golden I think we're golden this price is under this level right here it just simply has more logic of it heading to the downside than heading to the upside so for now we're going to set and forget next is going to be Euro gvp which we were interested in taking this position earlier but obviously no trade setup presented itself so we simply did not take the trade GBP JPY we were interested in taking this trade setup as well no trade setup has presented itself and then Euro GBP we were waiting for a break and retest above this area to take this trade no breaking retest no trade our only focus right now is on you USD Cad and truthfully I can honestly hide this ristor reward tool to over here because we technically did not enter that trade we're only involved in this one so I have my take profit set at this structure level right here on the 4our which honestly it's a bit of a stretch it's a nice 1 to three I don't really have to do all that I can you know go for a solid one to2 on this trade which would be right around this level and then on the 1 hour it would be right at this level of structure right around here more or less so we'll we'll shoot for the one to two and then when price gets there we'll determine to see what we're going to do so as of right now good morning ladies and gentlemen 2:09 in the morning and uh I'm probably going to continue to be here for a bit longer I'm going to try and maybe catch some sleep if I see some good momentum cuz I need to get back on my regular sleep schedule it's literally all over the place so for now set up no sleep this I just I'm not going to say anything I can't I'm not going to say anything all I'm going to all I'm going to do is just show you guys I'm going to say things later right right now I'm just going to not say anything I'm going to say things later cuz every single time I talk the market hears me and when the market it hears me it doesn't do what I wanted to do not going to say a word CU as soon as I started talking it trade update I am not going to say a word all I'm going to going to say all I'm going to say that's exactly what the [ __ ] I just said how does this even happen I told you guys the market hears me it hears me no doubt in my mind how do you go from being up $120,000 to now this where the market has had a 90% pullback from the last move that it has just done the 4-Hour time frame has had one of the craziest bearish engulfing candlesticks rejection EMA rejecting support and resistance how in the [ __ ] do we pull back 90% of that and literally 30 minutes how please Somebody explain I told you the market is listening to me it's listening to me so now I can't I'm just not going to say a word from this next sentence forward so then this can do this I'll check back in but look at this how are you going to dude how in never in a million years after a beautiful bearish engulfing Candlestick rejection from EMA structure look at this ginormous daily bearish engulfing Camp look at look at the size of that [ __ ] how do we retrace 60% of that bro I don't know what to do I think as soon as this goes back to break you and I'm just going to fck is that that's see that's me making an emotional decision I got to make a technic I got to make a decision based off of technical look at that bullish engulfing Maru Candlestick bro how in the [ __ ] does that even work I'm not being emotional I'm just stressed I'm literally just stressed cuz I've been looking at this [ __ ] for two and a half whole days why are you looking at it Alex so don't forget cuz I've been doing this for 11 weeks I want to finish this [ __ ] already there it is come on come on break even come on come on no no yes yes that's what I was waiting for Break Even yes come on come on come on come on no no no no no stop it stop it no you have 5 Seconds to go back to Rickie 5 4 3 2 2 one I'm actually stressing right now that's the [ __ ] up part come on come on come on come on [ __ ] come on go to [ __ ] break even you [ __ ] it has to go down bro oh come here buddy huh huh think I [ __ ] forgot about you no no no no no no no no I hav't no but I'm not done with you y yet I'll be back oh yes yes yes in profit like we weren't just up 70,000 [ __ ] dollars this shit's making me go crazy all right we just got out right now uh [ __ ] I don't know dude I don't even know how much that is um like $66,000 in profit 5,000 whatever bro what a swing dude how do you go from like 13 how do you go from $70,000 in profit to then $113,000 in drw down to now only making 4 grand tell me how that works couple weeks ago for Grand was a lot yeah it was I mean clearly it is now too we were begging for [ __ ] $1,000 in profit yeah dude we're done for the week There's no way I'm adding a position right now on a Friday and it just pisses me off because I know that this shit's going to go down I just know it so right now balance is at 45,000 show them the history cuz they always want to see the [ __ ] history I literally feel like I just took a weight off my shoulder shoulders I got to I got to I got to stop being so emotional bro I just got to stick to the plan dude sad and forget but [ __ ] that I can't let you guys down I can't let you guys like I'm doing this so you guys kind of don't have to like I'm showing you guys the struggle and the the reality of it so when you guys try to do this yourselves if you decide to there is there's hope there is somebody to to resignate from going through whatever you can potentially I'm going through anything you can possibly go through in this challenge fast wins fast losses quick profit back to draw down Break Even M trades Wick outs everything so when you guys decide to do this you can use me as an example and um hope you guys to be your joury what you come out of bro I [ __ ] knew it man ah bro that's why you got to trust your instincts [ __ ] man bro I'm telling you it's going to go down it just [ __ ] has to who's it she lives the [ __ ] good life she doesn't even know what's going on look at him you know what's so you know what annoys me that when I [ __ ] this right usually what I do to get my mind off of this is to go out on my boat but I don't have a boat right now it's broken it doesn't get any [ __ ] worse my boat almost sunk on me two weeks ago pop up the clip literally sunk on me in the middle of the river where there full of [ __ ] sharks [ __ ] man ah dude what do I do I I I buy another boat I don't have money to buy another boat whatever what you know what I think I should just get out of here so pretty much to wrap up the week you know it's uh good to have the market closed because now I can reflect on what happened and truthfully I got emotional but I didn't get emotional about the money it's just more of like the time like it's the same I'm realizing it's a pattern that's happening to me like at the beginning I'm very strict even if I lose I don't care and when I win I don't care but that's like at the beginning when I'm like two three weeks in four weeks 5 weeks like we're literally on week 11 right now so I'm like tired of this you know I'm just like in the whole routine and not sleeping same thing that the last time and I realized that when I get to this level is where I start making mistakes I start [ __ ] up because I simply am human you know and the difference between this time and last time is that I accept that last time I thought it was invincible and I didn't think that that would affect my trading at all but then obviously I blew the account morning guys so we're officially blowing the account and due to that we're now here again but now I know that and I accept that so this time around since I know and I accept that I know how to change that up so it happen to me I could actually pass a challenge which it's key for you guys out there that are somewhat successful but want to get to the next point is realizing what you're doing wrong accepting it and then actually taking action and executing and implementing what you did wrong to then fix it and start doing it right so if I'm tired if I'm breaking my training plan if I'm not setting and forgetting I have to accept that and then adjust and execute on doing it correctly for this upcoming week so I accept it I accept I've been emotional I accept that I have not been sticking to my training plan plan and I accept that I have not been getting any rest so what do I do this next week I simply do all of those things and you're going to see the difference from my results from this week that's happening right now to next week it's going to literally be night and day difference

I Turned $100 Into $332,588 in 12 Weeks Trading Forex
Oct 7, 2024

it's week 12 of me turning this into a million day trading and I have a feeling I'm going to have to use this this week good morning ladies and gentlemen before I get started today and I do a trade update I want to take this second to appreciate the Iguana being here like I don't I don't think you guys understand what this means for this week last week we ended off the week with the Iguana there's a lot of people watching me give me the signal and now we started off the week with the Iguana every single time the Iguana comes we make money am I right Am I Wrong do we not exactly what we're about to do right now technically the trades are loading so trade update right now the account is exactly the same currently at $200,000 on the account obviously same exact history so GBP nzd at the start of the yesterday we were interested in Waiting for a quick retest of this area to that sell and this would have been our first take profit 2169 but price decided to just start off the week and just have that push right from the get we didn't not have the retest and then sell even though yes we did hit our takeprofit Zone we can still technically enter this trade if it does manage to pull back all the way up to here because then it could create another lower low leg so I don't love this price action right now just sucks that the actual move happened at the start of the week without giving us the retest that we wanted to but we're still very much interested next is USD JPY looks like it's currently building and heading on its way up to here so we're just going to remain very patient waiting for price to retest this level support support and round psychological to then sell and then lastly Euro JPY we are at that area right now where we're looking to sell we are retesting the EMA whoa retesting the EMA retesting structure and retesting 160. now I'm going to be looking for my entry signal here right around the maybe 1 hour time frame or 30 minute time frame the only thing that I have to be on the lookout for this is that if USD JPY still has a lot more upside potential to potentially make it year to then sell that means that Euro JPY is going to have that same push to the upside so that means that this has a prob probility of breaking through here to then having the push once USD JPY actually reaches this level so you got to take that into consideration like just because this trade is at the area of Interest doesn't mean that it needs to have the push right away and just because this trade is not at the area of interest does it mean that it's not going to have the push right away this one just definitely has more probability of retesting this area rather than not every single time we get close to it we retest it when we're above when we're under we retested multiple times when we're under retested multiple times when we're above we retested multiple times so now that we're under I do expect for it to retest so then that means that this is just a fake out or an invalid area of interest and then it's going to make it up to then this next one that we potentially don't even have marked up here so very much on my toes with this trade and looking at it very very closely every hour and GBP nzd we're just waiting for price to make it up here to them so boring trade update it is currently 8846 in the morning and we'll update you guys as it goes if the Iguana stays there oh dude that's a sign bro that's a sign man that is the sign best sign I can possibly ask for this week to trade best sign all right ladies and gentlemen good evening so today it's been literally a boring day been home all day haven't done anything I haven't even left the day haven't even left the day haven't left my house today so it is currently 12:16 right now the balance on the account is currently exactly the same we still have not taken another position in the account we're still at 2 one come on focus focus there you go 21,000 but tonight ladies and gentlemen we're going to battle with the London session guys we are literally going to take the 200 to half million I don't know if to tonight I would really want it to be tonight but there's a high possibility it is tonight the trades had the move but are retracing to the air Adventures that I anticipated on Sunday with my students and I showed you guys yesterday so let me show you guys right now so first trade update is GBP nzd where we are currently having a retest of this structure level exactly how we've been anticipating and when you go down to the 4 Hour the 4 Hour is indeed coming back exactly to this area how I want wanted to what I love is that it created the lower high and lower low and it's having this pullback without breaking the structure so this is still technically the lower high this is still technically the lower low whatever happens in between here is nothing so this structure pullback does not shift the structure of the 4our so we can enter this trade here rejecting the area of interest and the EMA and it would be a perfect entry because our structure is still bearish I don't love that the 1 hour structure did go bullish because we were lower low lower high lower low lower high higher high now we're bullish we're getting very clear rejection price action on the 1 hour but I'm going to be waiting for a little bit more of a shift to structure on the 15 minute 30 minute it's going to be a little bit more selective on this trade simply because I like a lot more USD JPY you guys can see up here the time and the pairs so USD JPY simply looks a lot cleaner earlier today we were down here I was anticipating for price to make it back up here so technically I can remove this and now I expecting price from this point right here to have the P the downside perfect left head potential right shoulder daily time frame has come back to retest that daily area of Interest the previous daily body Candlestick did close under 144,000 so now it looks like we're just waking above kind of basically doing what we did here last time I do love how this is a very well respected level of support and support and I could very clearly see this having a reaction tonight for London session especially in London session I just need a little bit more price action as soon as we have a shift of structure on this Market I'm going to be interested in taking this trade this is the 30 minute time frame right now you guys can see up here to the top left corner so the only way I would be interested in executing this position is going to be at the break and retest of this 30 minute structure and that shi the structure on the 30 minute is going to be absolutely beautiful because and it's going to create another potential Head and Shoulders at the area of interest and then breaking and retesting 144,000 so it's going to be absolutely perfect I'm going to put my alarm under this 30 minute structure level and this is going to confirm to me that we're Shifting the structure so I'm going to actually double click it and type in here s oos shift of structure and then last but not least Euro JPY which we have clearly avoided a loss simply because of the explanation that I gave earlier Euro JPY yes it could be at the area of interest and we could be ready to sell but if USD JPY still has that much room to make a backup into this area it is just logically and technically going to make sense that if this has to have a deeper pullback to them cell that this Market has to have a deeper pullback as well it just happens to be at a different area of interest and we simply avoid this loss by experience a lot of the Traders would have seen this and entered the trade but they would have not realized that they could have cross correlated the pair with this one because obviously they both have JPY pairs so this is my number one pair right now I'm very interested in taking this trade as of right now well not right now as soon as we get structure but as of right now this is my number one pair and the next would be GBP nzd so stay tuned and I will update you guys at this current Curr 12:21 in the morning oh and real quick before we execute this trade and you guys are about to go crazy with the profits cuz I already I could already see myself making this money don't go crazy don't be like holy [ __ ] that was such a big trade I have to study exactly what he did there so I can do it again to make that much amount of money no at all I'm only making 1.5% of the account obviously it's 150% but we've done crazier flips in this series go look at the week one where we took 100 bucks to 3,000 reached the goal for the week actively right now we are currently up $330 you guys can see here we made 3,000% to me 3,000% is far more impressive than 150% now I get it it doesn't look impressive because it's just 100 bucks to 3K it doesn't sound like a big deal but percentage wise it is a lot more difficult and I have a lot more at risk when I took the 100 to 3,000 taking 200 to 500 percentage wise it's a walk in the park it is cake so I want to put this into your guys' mindset so you guys can really deeply understand that this is a percentage game it is not a dollar game it's not about the money it's about the percentage the percentage is going to directly influence the dollar amount that you're supposed to make on the trade so this is something that a lot of Traders as soon as they get it they start looking at the markets completely different and I highly suggest it quicker you implement it it's just going to turn into a different game for you it's it's can actually turn into a game it's not going to so much turn into a money thing it's just a game you just want to get more percentage and the percentage happens to equal money sounds fun to me good morning ladies and gentlemen I am not that energetic this morning even though what we said last night is happening slept for nothing I I I I missed just come here here trade update I feel like I I feel like I've said this a m million times trade update right now we are up $59,000 on the account but not only have I said this a million times I'm talking about this oh oh oh oh oh yo what is going on every single time yo what the [ __ ] yo it's every time dude yo I can't make this up dude yo I can't make this [ __ ] up bro I can't make this up bro I was literally going to say we have the head and shoulders pattern we see this pattern a gazillion times and then we usually always have the retest to then sell dude what is happening dude what is happening bro all right well look at that there goes our trade update right there we of 100,000 they'll go for the week as have a ticket bro what's there come on do your thing and dude I was just so calm I was so relaxed I was so Pacific well the goal was to show you guys that what I said we needed yesterday to happen which was The Head and Shoulders we put our alarm at the shift of structure and once we body close under it we get the retest and then we sell that's basically it we've we've said it a 100 [ __ ] times GBP nzd we had a little bit of a nice push last night we had the push to the downside I just didn't like this pair anywhere near as much as USD JPY because we weren't at the hardcore area of Interest how we are here gpusd still had room to make it all the way up to here so I didn't want to take that trade with that much space and then Euro JPY I just like USC JPY way better but pretty much exactly what I anticipated is happening right now bro what are we up there you go you can't make this up dude you cannot make this up okay so right now we are up exactly A1 to one and we're up about a 100,000 that means when we get to a 1 to two we should be up 200,000 and when we get to a 1 to three we'll be up 300,000 isn't that beautiful don't you want to have your easy math like that every single time you add a risk reward it's just an extra 100K 100K 100K sounds good to me so for now we're going to definitely set and forget this John all right trade up there boys let's see is anything C crazy else going to happen right now right now we are up about 118,000 the 30 minute time frame close exactly how I wanted to retest very bearish Candlestick to the downside 15 minute time frame we have beautiful 15 bearish and go from Candlestick looks like it's retouching the structure we're just destined to continue heading to the downside so for now so don't forget I can very easily Target very low in this market but I'm just going to be watching it one candle at a time I'm going to be very patient I'm not going I'm very excited internally but I'm not showing it because the last time I did that we blew the account can't let that happen again I'm remaining very calm very controlled and we'll update you guys in the next hour or two trade update we're up 20,000 Now isn't that crazy swings from like a swings from being up 50k to then Break Even In A Flash second then up 100K then a little bit lower 150 and now back up to 20,000 a regular human being a regular 9 to5 NPC nin to fivr cannot handle this you're not built for this respectfully right right off the bat you could develop and grow into it but that's what happens a lot of ninet to FS they want to get into trading and thinking that they're ready for this you know this is something that gets built over time you start cracking uh your EG sh breaking out of the 9th to5 mindset and your ability to be able to manage and control money so this is having a pullback looks like it's retesting the neckline once again so we were just up 20 now we're up 40 5 Seconds of talking [ __ ] now we're back at 30 oh man so for now set a fre up today is a sad day um actually might cry actually might cry so today's the day that we have to get rid of the Porsche bro touch my heart touch my heart like for real for real for real you going through bro literally so before I get rid of it I just want to say some things because my Porsche so I'm just going to read my letter to the Porsche to my Porsche on who I've spent nine faithful long months with you've been my first Porsche and I have blown many tires with you I'll miss you so much and our late night Shenanigans and pushing your buttons and flooring you to the rev limiter I it's the days when I would race you against other cars and you would always lose because you're so slow but you're trying your hardest and I know it I'll make the smooth and perfect transitions with the Rev matches every single time [ __ ] hurts I'll miss the way that you would open the door handles when I unlock the car just gives you the Sensation that you want me to drive you but the most important of all is I'll miss the thousands of miles I shared with you while you kept me safe and warm every single time no matter the circumstance or the tire condition you were always ready for the adventure my Porche now you guys may be asking Alex why are you setting the porsch what are you going through why are you doing that I got why is he leaving so slow so you have a chance to go get it back let's go all right ladies and gentlemen trade update it is currently 8:00 in the evening so not only is it a sad day because my Porsche has left but because we are now only up now $27,000 we were up 160 Grand but honestly I see this John went a lot lower so let me show you guys so right now daily time frame has closed as a beautiful magnif magnificent mag magnificent beautiful daily pin bar dogee red whatever you want to call it rejecting from this level of resistance level of support and level of support I think that now we can have a quick daily Wick match that Wick and then headed to the downside now that's going to suck because it's going to come right into our entry points where we are in the market and we obviously don't want to see that but I can definitely see us filling that ginormous Wick I love these huge Wicks because usually price always fills it when you're trading with the trend right now the 4our is accumulating it is having a higher low lower high lower low beautiful shif the structure and 30 minute time frame is still bearish this is still a lower high this to the lower low right now we just simply have to continue to be patient and wait for this to just have a reaction to the downside we are accumulating right at this area and we're clearly rejecting a multiple times it's pretty much destined for us to continue going to the downside gbpnzd on the other hand we are now officially making it to the area of Interest where we would be interested in taking the trade and we're having a reaction from that point I'm not interesting in adding a position on this at all just going to leave it like this to see what happens and the Euro JPY I had pretty much the move that I anticipated daily time frame beautiful daily bearish engulfing well almost engulfing Candlestick I could anticipate price to continue heading to the downside for now our only focus is UJ and to me we still have plenty plenty of downside potential so probably going to take another trade tonight you know what I'm saying kidding kind to just stay here and focus on the markets and then next week are we honestly this week we should start hitting the gym again when was the last time we hit the gym well you hit the gym probably like 3 weeks ago I hit the gym like this morning oh that's [ __ ] up you didn't invite me dude that's how you know I did it here at the house push-ups how many push-ups you think I can hit back to back I bet I could hit more than you back to back Maria Maria we need you to jump off of this right now okay hold it again turn it hold it ready are are you sure you get us both in the frame yeah are you sure yes do I look talk down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 and my posture was for real that was a good try my breath all right guys Trad up day this is why I didn't want to celebrate earlier or be anywhere near excited because I expected for something like this to happen we are currently down about $25,000 in the account when we were up earlier about 150,000 at the height of it what you think I'm going to just [ __ ] and cry right now no dude this is part of the set and forget I'm going to continue sticking to my trading plan and let this [ __ ] ride I am almost more confident about this position compared to USD CAD of last week if you guys were in that series last week you guys would know let me just show you guys the USD CAD now is having a pullback right up to 144,000 once again so if I were to look at this on The Daily time frame you guys can see that the daily has created that long Wick and I mentioned that it was going to reach the top of that wi now we just happen to be surpassing that which is not good not good now we can uh well honestly we can get stopped out on this [ __ ] I can't I'm not even going to lie but you know what I'm still very confident that we will fill that Wick I do love how the structure is looking like on the 30 minutes I love how it's still bearish this is still technically the lower high and this is still technically the lower low if anything I'm going to be interested in adding new positions very very soon if I obviously get a reaction from here and engulfing how we've done here and how we've done here I'll probably add a position but until then I'm going to continue to set and for get GBP nzd the trade we did not take is having very nice move it's usually how it goes I do think that it's going to continue going to the downside and if we do manage to have a little lower high I might consider entering positions to the downside so for now again we set up foret here Euro JPY I think it can make it up a little bit higher be this that structure in the EMA to them s so if that has that little bit more of a pushup to that cell then that means that USD JPY probably has a little bit more of a pushup to that cell so for now just going to sit on our hands and be patient and uh as of right now now 10:38 at night we're down 24,000 it's not that bad you look like [ __ ] I just got dided not actually dided all right I don't want that to get the wrong message across the markets Diddy did the did out of me look at this price went not only straight into our stop- loss but a complete violation break through the previous structure level almost through the screen and out the [ __ ] roof we just got Diddy DD in the DD is that even real [ __ ] you know I'm supposed to be raging right now I would be throwing the chair I would be throwing the astronaut I would go crazy shoot the screen but you know what this there's nothing to rage about I I can't I would take this trade 10 times over every single time it were to give me the opportunity luckily we did not risk much on the position we are only back at 135,000 and we only took about a $68,000 loss on the account which given this trade I should have risked 100% but I explain to you the higher I go in the account I lower my Risk by 20 5 to 50% so I'm not even mad I I I'm not it's just it's one of those losses with this type of approach but look at this like we got did didy so [ __ ] crazy we have a beautiful daily bearish engulfing Candlestick 1 2 3 4 5 six days rejecting from level of support support and resistance daily bearish pin bar the last thing I would [ __ ] expect is this didy what the [ __ ] so when you go to the 4our you see a beautiful 4our lower low creating a lower high at the area of Interest resistance round psychological level 4our engulfing 1 hour left head right shoulder it's everything you would want to see in a position I can nearly almost almost guarantee you that out of 10 positions that you were to take on this you will have a minimum 40% win rate so you'll lose six of these you get six didies and then you'll get six four who should the four what are the what's like a w what's a represent because didd equals L what's a representation of a w 69 you get that's so far from a w I know that's another L you'll get four W's and then six L's let's say you risk 1% it's minus 6 on these four that you win let's say you get a minimum of a 1 to two risk to reward which we were aiming here for a 1 to 3.8 realistically a 1 to four so these four positions 4 * 4 what is it 16 so subtract the 6% that you just lost on these you're left with 10% so this is a pattern that I'll take every single time can't even make something super entertaining um not me being real like there's other times where I'm generally actually mad or pissed off but bro now I I accept this loss fully because I will take this trade every single time now on the other hand let me just put this John up we're going to probably have to break our trading plan it's going to have to happen and we might have to break our trading plan because I don't see the three markets that we were interested in trading this week to give us a good opportunity and I still want to hit the goal for the week but I have to keep in mind I know I made the same mistake exactly one year ago I blew the challenge on NFP what a coincidence that this Friday is NFP the first Friday of every month is NFP and literally one year ago I blew the challenge on a Friday with NFP when we were at the same exact amount on the balance of the challenge [ __ ] gives me goosebumps I don't know that's pure coincidence but this is me showing you guys that I learned from my lessons and that I am not going to make the same mistake again so this right now is not giving me a solid opportunity I am no longer executing a position in this market especially after a move like that the move is B basically gone next is going to be gbpnzd so if we would have taken this position we would have actually taken a loss because price did not have the whole entire move how I anticipated even though I still like the fact that we could still potentially have a reaction from here to the downside and then we have Euro JPY which we were anticipating for price to have a reaction from here to then head to the downside but we did not have that move how we wanted to obviously because of the JPY what happened on USD JPY happened on your JPY as well so none of these three markets are super super high probability trade setup except this one I can still enter a good trade setup on gbpnzd I can still get a price to come up here into round Cy logical 2.12 then wait for the Shi to structure to then sell so we could probably wait for that but what I'm going to do now is I'm going to look for different markets that I was analyzing on Sunday swings and I wasn't giving it the best grade to trade for this week and see if I can find an opportunity there that is breaking my trading plan because I would never go back into the markets that I did not add to the watch list and add them to my watch list because I don't find Opportunities the current markets that is me being greedy and going to find these markets but I know what I'm doing I accept it I know I'm breaking my trading plan so what happens when I do I have to drive the Beetle and I accept that I know I'm doing something wrong it's not like I'm not doing something wrong and I'm not going to hold myself accountable I know I'm doing something wrong and I'm going to hold myself accountable so I'm going to see if I can find another Market if not we're just going to focus on GBP nzd so until then I don't forget I found one I found one let me take you off this actually I'm just going to bring you with me like this all right boys we got the tripod in the house all right boys so I actually found a very decent opportunity in the market with actually one of my favorite pairs which is going to be GBP CHF so GBP CHF right now on the daily time frame it is clearly showing that it has a very strong left head and then like a right shoulder price is now pulling up to this area of interest on the weekly time frame you guys can see that we are retesting this level of structure right here the last week we had a weekly bearish rection Candlestick and we are cre kind of creating a doe right now this week when you go down to the daily daily you can see that the price action is clearly not liking this area what I don't love is that we are above this level of support right here we're clearly above it but I could see price have a push to the downside and then I when you go to the 4H hour you can very very very clearly see that the 4 Hour went from creating higher highs and higher lows to now having a shift to the downside side so if this were to be like the middle of New York session or London session I would take this trade pretty much right now in a heartbeat but it is currently 11: in the afternoon no I mean it's 1:00 in the afternoon so there's no more Market volume so I pretty much can't take this trade anymore just because we're at a session we can only take a pre- London session which will be like at 12:00 tonight midnight Miami time and we have gbpusd which ironically enough they're both GBP pairs but this one I'm actually interested in buying it so we have a retest of this structure level weekly time frame is bullish daily time frame is bullish or bearish depending how you want to look at this but we are retesting this very strong level of support and resistance and is very well respected throughout here and now we are above that zone so we can see a push to the upside you can see here on the 4our at the 4 Hour is indeed having some type of a reaction from that point but I think the only way I can buy it is going to be at the break and retest up here because I think price could actually pull up into this area and then have a reaction to then the downside so I'm just going to be very much on the lookout the 1 hour time frame looks decent but if we break and retest above this I'll be a lot more interested in it so we have gbpusd now for buys and GBP CHF for sales or maybe even sales on gbpusd if we pull up into here and then we have nice rejection so for now all I can say is stay tuned all right we F to the park have to make sure that the B's a little dirty [ __ ] okay this ball let's get the other one can never get enough of these balls no Diddy all right so today looks like we're alone at the gym the rain scared a little bit of people away but we're not going to let that stop us look at this we're the only people here you know what that means I don't really I don't really know what that [Music] means oh [ __ ] but trading is kind of like playing basketball like right now I'm playing basketball myself and it's boring I have to catch M with rebounds I have to hold myself accountable when I miss I have to be here by myself and it gets boring trading it's kind of like that as well when you're trading by yourself right now let's say you're in your office you're in your living room in your bedroom wherever you're trading it gets boring so one of the main reasons as well why I'm doing the 30-day boot camp is cuz I know when I complete this 100 to the mill series I'm going to be bored again so me taking on this new challenge taking a hand selected amount of people teaching them how to trade taking them from Level 0 to 100 30 days live with me where I'm taking you by the hand oneon-one it's fun it's like playing basketball with a team with some people that don't know how to play you got to teach them how to shoot got to teach them how to dribble sucks at the beginning but the end result is fun when you see that person that you didn't know how to trade do something like this I know I made it no well you got to miss some too right but the point is that I know that once I complete the challenge I was going to be bored so now that when I complete it I'm going to take on this new challenge which going to teach a hand select and amount of people on how to trade using my same exact set and forget strategy the updated version on how I turn the 100 into the mill 30 days live with me so more on that later because for right now we can't do anything until we don't complete the challenge because how am I going to teach you how to do it if I haven't even done it myself so for now I and forget today we're locking in for London session part A th000 we've done this so much already have you even showered today I haven't I haven't I don't think I've eaten today have I eaten holy [ __ ] dude you see how skinny I am wow you don't look fat holy [ __ ] yeah I haven't eaten today what time is it 11:06 at night who oh market update hair's still looking like Frankenstein or Albert Einstein I feel like Albert Einstein right now like twitching out and [ __ ] genius bro you know Albert Einstein has projects that sometimes don't don't do well and right now we are not doing well we're still at the same exact spot still no new positions into the account so our trade ideas are going to potentially start moving as of right now so we have gbpusd which we can now see a double bottom from this area to then buy daily time frame closed pretty decent I like that little daily dogee at this level 4our time frame Little D B you know what I'm saying the 1 hour this looks actually not that I this just doesn't look like anything right so I need to have some type of reaction and then I'll enter this straight to the upside but the real trade that I want to enter is at the break and retest of this and then next is going to be GBP CHF for cells I love how this price action is currently looking right now daily time frame close with the daily dogee and if you go down to the 1 Hour 1 hour has had what looks to be like a little double top I'm literally going to wait for a break and retest under this area right here so this is kind of like the consolidation Zone it's in so I want to have some type of break out of this and then a quick retest to then sell a little breakout then a quick retest then sell everything depends on the price action but I want to enter here but I can't enter here right now I need the breakout confirmation and then the pull back to enter here I don't mind entering a little bit lower but I just need the confirmation that it's having a breakout and time to move um and aside from that GBP nzd is not giving us any entries anytime soon so price completely blew through the area of interest that we had set up at 21200 and we can just wait for a little quick break and retest to then sell on the 4our if price were to decide to do that not really interested in this and then USD JPY just completely violated our whole entire trade idea so our only focus right now is GBP CHF for sales a quick little day trade for a 1 to two and G DP USD for little quick day trade for buys now Albert Einstein out you're not going to say nothing today huh you say nothing today huh great update we are up 238,000 mother the [ __ ] dollars you know what I'm not going to rage again I'm not going to get excited I'm like I'm like I'm like ready I'm like ready to [ __ ] Dash and [ __ ] you know what one not only are we not near the goal for the week the go for the week is half a m so we're off by 1:30 and two there's nothing to celebrate just yet the trade has not closed do not get excited Okay g GP CHF trade update so right now we have three very unique entries on GBP CHF and I want to explain them to Perfection because this moved very fast literally only like 4 hours this is just one Candlestick so GBP CHF we had the 4H hour bearish and golfing how I wanted from that area and then we obviously entered at the breakout of all of this consolidation Zone here I entered on this 1 in the morning Candlestick as as it was getting ready to close entered right there spread took me a little bit down and then we add our next entry on this 15-minute pullback so we had the full move I'm like yes amazing beautiful but then we had this pullback and on this pullback I waited for this engulfing confirmation we entered on this pullback of this Wick and then the next entry we entered at the bottom of that rejection candle right there and those are our three entries we have our first one up here our second one right here and our third one right around here and our takeprofit was very strategically placed at this next 4H hour low so as you can see the 4 Hour is clearly bearish higher high higher low D bearish lower low lower high lower low lower high we're destined to create a new lower low but up to where up to this structure point and you can clearly see that price has very well reacted from that structure point this is only a 1 to 2.7 risk reward and we've risked a lot lot more than what we're risking here on different markets this move just happens to be very very volatile like we're up 102 Pips right now or takeprofit 130 so I never close my trades with the takeprofit numbers I always close my trades manually and I do it automatically so technically we're up a 1 to two right now which is what we would usually want from a trade but I just see so much more downside Potential from this trade but I don't know if I see it like today this is what this daily Candlestick has done and I don't know how much more motion this shit's got like I don't I don't know if it could just today like you guys have to be realistic with yourselves like you could be right about the trade and my analysis indicates to me that this trade can make it all the way up to here but when will it make it up to there today tomorrow the next day the day after even have that much time you look at the calendar what is tomorrow tomorrow is the first Friday which is NFP so we Technic we technically only have the rest of New York session today because it is currently 9 in the morning and then we have London session tonight and then New York session on Fridays are pretty whack so you have to ask yourself do you think this daily Candlestick has enough motion to keep going to this level here probably not like if you just measure this daily Candlestick right here what was the last time you had a daily Candlestick move that much right let's go find out not here that one this one day engulfed these two days engulfed every single one of these days engulfed engulfed engulfed like since basically this day right here August 88th we haven't had a Candlestick this big now yes usually whenever we have a Candlestick that big the next days it's the continuation but if you see right here it's 2 days two days of just slow down and then continuation do we have time for two days days do we no because then it's the weekend like these are all these high Lev things that you have to take into consideration when you're deciding if you want to continue to hold or close a position so for right now I'm just going to wait for this Candlestick to close in about 57 seconds to determine what exactly I want to do hopefully what it does is the same thing as op is we decide to watch it and then what happens if right that would that' be pretty sick I not going to lie all right GBP USD so we can explain these we're waiting for a double bottom to then buy no trade we did not buy GBP and ZD had to move exactly how we wanted to and it's having a very clean bearish engulfing reaction from it this is probably a trade that I'll be interested in taking next week I think tomorrow it's going to have a pullback Friday nothing Monday nothing and Tuesday it will have the push so we can have that trade on Tuesday USD JPY just completely continued to the upside and then your JPY is kind of just consolidating here so GBP CHF is currently um 3 2 1 well this is not epic all right do we hold do we close do we hold do we close um dude honestly I feel like I could [ __ ] feel that all day I would say let's look at another 15 minutes like let's wait for this 15-minute Candlestick cuz D I definitely feel like I could have a reaction from here here cuz look like right where price is at if you look left support resistance resistance like it's a very well respected level and I think it could respect it man I really do think my goes again half a m i don't know how much I'll be when I'm down here like I don't know if I'll be up to like 400 I'm not being greedy by the way just take that into consideration I'm just maybe I am I'm already driving the beo today so what's the big deal all right we'll wait I'll make a decision soon update you guys all right boys I had to stand up for this one trade update we closed at 332,000 trade history as you guys can see we have officially closed the position at the highest point keyw we've closed the position we were just up 400,000 we lost 70k just because of [ __ ] floating [ __ ] clean out well you know what we actually want to trade we shouldn't be doing that right sorry we have Sensei here Sensei my friend my friend so trade update Clos the position right around here so I came to the executive decision that you know what we did have a rejection from this level of support the strong thing the smart thing to do is to not hold and be greedy so we decided to just literally close our position here out of 1 to two I do see this having a downside potential but not without a pullback and I don't want to handle the pullback so I think it's actually the fastest trade in the whole entire challenge basically took like 5 6 hours that being said it is currently 9:27 and we're done for the day now we're going to drive the Beetle and see where the day takes us I think it's time for me to be able to [ __ ] fix up my hair you know finally change clothes and change clothes I haven't showered in 2 days I have showered I'm just wearing you guys notice it's the same hoodie different shorts I bet you didn't notice that so we are going to set and forget got to make sure it's neutral no Diddy come on come on no horn oh how can I forget bro forgot to turn on the switches dude [Music] all right we cannot risk this turning off so we got to go oh we got to move oh we got to move no we don't have time we don't have time we have get out of the way get out of the way oh my neighbors right come let's go H want to see oh the beetle I love this thing you Lo until you [ __ ] have to drive it everything it's not that bad bro it's actually not that bad it's not that bad right now but bro when the sun is like this on you with the heat it's terrible this bro has no AC there's no [ __ ] ventilation nothing where the [ __ ] the engine in the back you have to drive with the pop yeah cuz they probably to catch fire so we have to like leave it like that so that's it doesn't look bad right so we're missing um the other one here but you know doesn't have brake lights doesn't have headlights nothing bro it actually suits you bro you look like that guy little car for a little guy and yo that this this is the fuel tank right here so if you crash no yeah lit [ __ ] car explodes in other words I mean bro this is the engineers you weren't surviving anyway you weren even if it doesn't explode you wen't going to I don't think it has airbags bro this is from 66 dude 1966 probably like the fact this thing still moves is actually cool pretty sick yeah how did you even get where did you find this Facebook Marketplace every single night before I go to sleep I dedicate 30 minutes to Facebook Marketplace like I'll just put like the geographic like national area I'll put like Texas and you get some crazy ass [ __ ] bro I just [ __ ] oh [Music] oh I like your car thank you you want to trade no why not thank you so [Music] much I didn't work she since she hit me with the I guarantee you I put up next to this gold digger and my Bugatti and the energy will be very very very different y she got so close to the other car she almost even hit it all right so boys let this be a lesson for you guys out there that it's not you it's the circumstance that you're in and all they care about is they want to feel good about the circumstance that they're going to potentially be a part of so I get it I don't blame her but I obviously know she's a gold digger I don't really give a [ __ ] I'm going to literally go home now into my $3 million house and she's probably going to have to go home to her husband that's cheating on her yo I love it she literally said the successfully made it home once again proves the method that this car does not pick up women morning ladies and gentlemen it is currently 154 in the afternoon the account is at the exact same as you guys can see we have not entered any new positions on the account which is kind of interesting cuz this week we lost 100 no we lost 70,000 right off the bat and then we made it back up by like almost making a quarter which is good the goal for the week was half Ma we're shy by $170,000 which in retrospect is a lot monetarily R but percentage wise of what we've done to the account it's really nothing but what we did do is avoid losses so GBP CHF we were interested in taking the loss here on Thursday night basically Friday morning but we obviously weren't interested in it and we were going to enter the trade on this pullback once we would have the rejection and the engulfing on this pullback we never did so we never entered this position simply avoiding that loss and we close our trade perfectly at this point right here because I explained if we reach this level we're then going to have a reaction it's exactly what we did so we avoided this loss right here and we made sure that we close our our trade perfectly because if we would continued to hold and be greedy and want to catch it all the way down here this trade would have literally taken us out a break even in a loss right now which would suck let me take off these lines then we have GP USD obviously never gave us the entry we never took it GBP nzd we never took this sell position as you can see we were waiting for the pull back into here wait for the entry signal to then sell we got no entry signal no shift to structure no rejection price pulled up and it just never stopped and we completely avoided this loss by remaining patient and following this trading plan USD JPY continue heading to the upside and Euro JPY continue heading to the upside so this week was pretty decent we made a good amount of money and uh all I can say is that next week might be the week next week might be the week where we actually turn the half well not the half a mill into a mil cuz if we turn 300K into a million that means we would have to risk a 100% of the account and catch a one to three risk reward so we risk 100% catch a quick intraday trade cuz to make a one to three you're going to have to let it ride for a little bit but if you're risking that much not really I don't know next week might be the week is what I'm saying we can actually make the 300K into a million if we catch a nice one 2 three risking 100% it's kind of interesting all right so I might have just gotten the weirdest thing in the mail right now but inside of this letter was this not I don't even want to touch it just look at it way is I swear I'm not hacking you please watch video and this was what was inside of the envelope I don't want to touch it cuz I don't know if it's going to blow up so I have it in here just in case if it blows up it's a minor explosion not a major explosion and I'm not going to open this on my computer here I'm not [ __ ] [ __ ] they actually might be hacking me it might be a trick so we're going to go to a public computer and plug it in and see what this is this is mad weird I've never gotten something this weird in the mail Lally got here today I don't know nothing in the back let's go let's go to the computer so we just got here you hold it oh you're Savage bro all right so we came to FIU FIU business the school where they're going to teach you how to be a successful entrepreneur know no [ __ ] here all right we just want this random classroom classroom 154 all right cool all right hand me the thing where the hell did we put this into I'm nervous FX I'm not a creep I swear I apologize for the slight invasion of privacy and s sight you [ __ ] said USB to my heart oh [ __ ] you're not you're not starting off good brother I've been watching no wait Alex swing my first name allit he sent another he said another watch the other one FX Alex G Mark Mark let me let me tell you something right now Mark I I love the creativity um I think it's very unique but dude dude dude now I'm moving out some more diversity on your channel man some diversity hey can't you want more diversity than this and this and this I'm I'm you got Arab you got you got Dr really I can't believe you said that that's not true not aied team we are qualified Personnel team I don't care if you're black Asian fat Chinese woman women I'm the only girl as well well you do qualified welcome thank you B also I quit hold on hold on hold on hold on let me see what else one of those movies the fact that he put Kendrick and not Drake l oh that's it that's it yeah Drake is way better than Kendrick who the [ __ ] is Kendrick Mark no but on the real Mark appreciate the message um one you didn't leave a caught action I don't even know how to get in contact with you and two um yeah that's all I can say but so yeah now we're going to go to actually you know what you know what actually me being in this class right now makes me realize something like imagine showing up to this class every single day for 4 years imagine sitting here listening to a professor and writing down the geographic algebra mathematician of whatever the [ __ ] to not even be really successful in life like think about that for a second people literally come into here they sit around other unsuccessful people and there is a 1% chance actually under 1% chance according to this stat from a very famous news article that only 1% of people that go to college actually become successful isn't that sad that you come here for 4 years and you know that maybe not even one of the people sitting inside this class will actually make it and have the life that they really want I think that's sad that's why in the 30-day boot camp that I'm going to do do with 30 days just me oneon-one you have not only more odds of succeeding than an average person you're going to have more odds are succeeding than anybody in a classroom like this and like literally in the 30day boot camp that I'm going to do the success rate of people having results 30 days 45 days after the boot camp is about a 50 to 60% so you being successful coming to a corporate class like this is 1% the odds of you being successful after 30 days is 50% isn't that crazy what logically makes more sense spend four years and tens of thousands of dollars and be in an ugly environment like this like I have to go take a shower I can't believe I'm sitting in this chair honestly I have to like that makes me unprofitable or you can be part of a winning circle that everybody has the same ambition and the same drive to actually be successful and you're learning a craft that is going to make you money coming into here and watching a teacher that has no idea about money has never had a business because if they do they wouldn't be here teaching you they would be running a business they wouldn't be here making 40 50k a year where you're literally just learning from them what is being read off of a tablet like this or being read off of a book now your professor Alex G is here take a seat sir take a seat sir did you bring your notes no did you do your homework no how have you not done your [ __ ] homework now you get an F for not completing your task now I failed you now you have to go do it again is that the life you want so what do you want to do you want to go to school want be part of the 30-day boot camp where do you think you're going to make more money 30-day boot camp so why you sitting in that [ __ ] chair that's what I'm talking about all right guys so right now we're going to go pick up my twin turbo I'm actually I'm actually pulling up which is funny you're actually pulling up yeah I'm down the street perfect not it it so I told these guys I'm like yo I want to wrap it green for swing trading lab cuz we're going to do the 30-day boot camp and all that you know guys how I go crazy with the marketing and stuff so and it's rear wheel drive which is sick because I'm able to do donuts so when I get it now I get to Bugatti back on Monday I'm going to do donuts around the Bugatti with the green Lambo which is going to be sick it's a wide body one in the whole world so it's a pretty nice shade of green what the why why is it pink wanted a pink right no I said green green yeah we only had pink though what the [ __ ] I'm sorry kidding I got him I got oh [ __ ] actually honestly not that many people could Rock pink cars I think one I'm one of like this little bit amount of people that could do it shout out to the number one scammers in Miami uh charged me 8 Grand for this job which is [ __ ] crazy but you know what I'll pay it to them all day because gets it done on time you know bro I'll rip it here and do donut you yeah that's what I was calling you for okay sick yeah I do [Music] it now up Alex has he seen it or no yeah he was here today oh you saw it what do you think yeah it looks crazy bro you really good I was telling Kevin it looks like an Aventador looks really good a few people have told me that really yeah that's how you cheap your way into an Aventador [Music] she

How I Turned $100 into $1 Million In 90 Days
Oct 18, 2024

I did it I did it I turned the 100 into the mill nobody believed in me where I did it $91,000 $200,000 $332,400 th000 in profit so we be at $600,000 $824,000 smackaroos boys bro three [ __ ] months turning $100 into $1 million I'll never forget the day after my birthday as I'm celebrating it I'm like well why should I be celebrating my birthday if I don't feel like I've achieved one of the biggest things that I've been wanting to achieve that's turning $100 into a million I failed three four five times in front of hundreds of thousands of people which is humiliating we're officially be the account we about to hit margin car right now and uh I kind of took a break from social media I I it cracked me I didn't have what it took to be that Traer to have that flip even though I had made multiple seven figures in trading I simply didn't have the mindset I didn't have the willing power to push through all the negativity and push through the battles that I was going to go through in this challenge to succeed so a day after my birthday I said [ __ ] it let's do it what's the worst that can happen we fail we do it again and little did I know the year that I took off the challenge to become this now stronger Trader and more built for it was the time that I was actually going to achieve it this time my target was to double the account every single week meaning we start off with 100 take it from 100 to 200 200 to 400 400 to 800 800 to 16 and so on and according to my calculations we should finish the challenge in about 3 months give or take depending if we enter a losing streak and how much we lose in that losing streak and we're looking for a risk reward of a 1 to2 meaning if we risk 100% of the account we want to gain 200% so that way we can actually meet the double every single week and every single trade like always I'm going to share on my Instagram on my telegram on my Discord on my YouTube everything so people can go and watch Journey for themselves and learn from it and see that it's actually possible and little did I know that I was about to make history in the trading industry turning $100 into a million day trading in under 3 months and this is how it went I'm going to try and turn these $100 into a million and we got to hurry up because the market is officially open 9:45 on Monday and we already have the account ready to go so my goal the first week is to take the $100 into $200 meaning I risk 100 to make 200 and as I'm actually going to be identifying the top markets that I'm going to be trading for the week I had a curious idea let me go look back at the previous challenge that I did to see if the markets that I'm going to going to be trading for the first week have some type of connection or correlation with the first markets that I traded in the last Challenge on the first week 11 months ago you can clearly see this guy right here which by the way I don't know who this guy is or who he thinks he is wearing three chains look at him but you can see right here in the markets actually so the first two pairs were actually GBP Cad and GBP USD for this time around literally a year later when we're doing the challenge it's actually the second pair and then the third pair was actually pretty crazy this just hyped me the [ __ ] up meaning that I am on the right path and have a clear mindset going to execute the trades that I need to execute in order to pass this challenge that nothing has changed in my strategy technical wise the only thing that has changed is the trader executing this strategy and a big difference between this Challenge and the last one is that I am not going to let the challenge interfere with my day-to-day life there's something different that I want to do with this challenge is keep a perfect balance not be cuz I don't want to get drained I don't want to get burnt out of the challenge so what I'm going to do is actually stay in my routine do my business meetings go to the gym go out before what I would do I would just stay up 24/7 throughout the whole week and I was burnt out the weekends I would just catch up on sleep and then do it again in the last Challenge and that's probably the main reason why I was burnt out and blew it this time that is not going to happen I'm going to get shredded during this challenge cuz it's also a financial challenge but a physical challenge because I really do think that I can get to the best point I've ever physically been in in my life last time I looked like a Hermit I was just stuck in my house not leaving not going to the gym no social life no regular day-to-day stuff and I got blinded I got lost in the journey and I started just seeing things that I shouldn't be seeing and like usual every single Sunday I would pick my top three top four markets that i' be trading for the week set my alarms and then be ready to take the trade either London or New York session and I think the first pair I was going to trade was gvp JPY all right guys good morning it is currently July 16th Tuesday morning so obviously stayed up last night it's about like 3:00 in the morning is I stayed up to catch this trade and it was for no reason we are currently in the position and this is literally the max that I can honestly risk on the account so last night remember that I explain to you guys that I was waiting for the market to have a body closure under this line right here so we had that body engulfing Candlestick and then I pretty much entered on the little quick pull back of the next one and now that was for no reason because all of London session as soon as I fell asleep literally did nothing but the point is that now price is pulling back into the area where we entered usually what should happen is as soon as we enter the trade it just goes down with the momentum of the session but now we haven't but it is what it is enter the trade s forget my prediction is that now from here it is going to go down and as soon as I take the first position obviously you have to risk 100% of the account to even get out of that hole and I remember that I wasn't draw down as soon as I took the trade I'm like ah here we go starting off bad and I think we're were in draw down about 35 bucks right at the start so then there it's either going to completely blow the account or Skyrock me out of it so it can give me the balance that I need to then take on the next week and follow the goal that I have for every single week I got it 1 minute ago positive $15 now we are about to hit Margin Call on the account 1 minute later but this trading is so funny dude oh my God but like always when the trade went into draw down I wasn't going to panic I sudden forget because worst case that can happen I just blow 100 bucks and I start right again and guess what happened trade hit take profit ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry to announce that we have reached the goal for the week actively right now we are currently of $330 you guys can see here last night literally what I said happened once again so look check out GBP JPY right after that 1 hour bearish engulfing Candlestick literally the whole momentum throughout London session was that bearish move to the downside had my takeprofit sets at a one to 3.4 risk reward so meaning if I risked 100 bucks here then I would made $340 right here as you guys can see that is literally the math that is happening right now Candlestick is going to close in 15 minutes over here so I want to see how this Candlestick closes right here in 15 minutes and then based off of that I'll then make my decision and let's see if we can then this week flip this $450 to then $800 or $900 because that would put us really really really fast into the margin that we need to be in order for us to flip the $100 to the mail a lot faster it's currently 2:30 in the afternoon pretty much we close at a $437 in profit you guys can see here the my effect book pretty much how it's looking currently up $437 these are pretty much the fees we got to pay these are the orders or there's nothing open right now this is the history though you guys can see here both positions that we ended up taking that's the profit that we Clos in and now same [ __ ] gym time know it sucks that we only get to drive one Supercar now Lamborghini twin turbo just sold it wide body ears is at the shop the rear brake caliper is broken they're fixing it the Porsche I blew the second gear here on the Porsche drifting uh rollsroyce is finally getting done wrapped should be done today or tomorrow what other the car do I have the mayb I'm not going to drive oh yeah oh I sold the Scat Pack got rid of the Scat Pack Scat Pack is gone that was probably the dumbest thing I ever bought yeah the side by side the side by side is in the shop as well bro half of my fleet right now is in the shop I only get to drive a Ferrari right now we were up 430 bucks I think and we hit the goal not only for week one but for week two meaning that I didn't have to execute a trade next week or the week after because this one trade because we said and forget and we caught a one to three risk to reward we outdid The Profit that we were even anticipating for this very same week just to get started so we were off to a very good start right at the beginning so since the week was off to a good start I pretty much came to the executive decision that you know what we hit the goal not only for this week but for next week we're done for the week let's not get greedy let's not Chase any trades let's just set and forget for the rest of the week and next week will come back with new Fresh Market new fresh mindset and then we'll pick up on the goal which is going to be then taking $400 to about $900 so then that's exactly what we did we did not take any other opportunities and then the next week we started off fresh with a new goal and if we were to hit it we're then ahead 3 weeks in the challenge which is absolutely beautiful it's week two of me trying to turn $100 into a million day trip so like always we started off the week on Sunday swings analyzing the top two top three markets that we're going to be trading for the week and we found some solid markets where it can probably even more double the account account is still on $437 we got I think seven solid markets in the markets seven solid markets in the markets it's a lot of markets it's a lot of [ __ ] money USD JPY so USD JPY has a very clean left head kind of right shoulder action going around here we broke the neckline now we are retesting the neckline of The Head and Shoulders along with the 1H hour EMA 4H hour time frame looks absolutely phenomenal we're having a a beautiful 1H hour bearish engulfing Candlestick looks like we're having that pullback to retest that previous structure level and then the daily time frame does not get any cleaner than this daily previous structure level daily EMA and then you guys can look left it is obviously a level of resistance whenever we're under a level resistance whatever we're under and this line right here what is it you may be asking around psychological level 157500 or like the smart money concept guys would call it an order block potato potato this is a round psychological level with an area of Interest so this trade is my number one trade that I'm going to be interested in taking this week all I'm really waiting for on this market so earlier this week what I was waiting for was this break so that break already happened and now this pullback is actively happening so I just got to wait for price to go back into this area so I can actually enter this trade we took the trade which was on USD JPY I believe yo up yo oh [ __ ] with me huh [ __ ] with me literally USD JPY as simple and as effective as I get look at this [ __ ] we literally had the retest perfectly to the area of Interest the Maru tweezer top rejection bearish engulfing Candlestick I keep telling you you need an engulfing Candlestick to enter a thow or a bullish and golfing to enter bu I'm laughing cuz the mic is moving so the point is that we're in this trade right now literally we already at $550 if this [ __ ] hits that take profit we'll probably be at like 2 3K it will probably even break the goal for the week that we've been anticipate so for now just going to S forget but it was taking a little bit long so I'm not going to sit in front of the computer all day and basically do nothing I just exactly what I said at the beginning of the challenge I'm going to go play basketball I'm going to go hit the gym I'm going to go live my normal life so it doesn't respect my psychology and I can always have a fresh mindset when I'm actually going to execute a trade and I treat the market it's one thing and then my life my personal life is a completely other thing you can either literally make us or break us it is currently 8:00 p.m. Miami time so I think it's like about 2 hours or an hour and a half from the last time I updated you guys and set and forget now what we're going to go do is pick up Jordan and for those of you guys that don't know who Jordan is he's actually one of my top students where about 6 years ago he was actually working at aviation in a place like this but he wasn't flying the airplanes he was fixing them he was a mechanic fixing the planes that were broken down probably making 50 60k a year and he didn't want to live that life he wanted to have a obviously successful life and because of the set and forget strategy he managed to not only get out of his job but make trading his main source of income in just under two years which is absolutely legendary and over time we become really really close friends so Jordan obviously you know is battling cancer and stuff and his legs get really really swollen and have a cold plune so cold water helps with inflammation we're going to put him inside the cold plune in about like 20 30 minutes so we're going to pick them up now and show you guys the whole drink all right so this Jordan we're going to take him out to the cold plunge it's going to suck bro it's going to suck it's cold right it's cold plunge dude it's going to [ __ ] suck but I'm telling you you're going to get out you're going to feel [ __ ] amazing so you know we would pick him up take him to the cold plunge and then drop him back off he actually gave me some Mike Tyson sign gloves which is super sick because you know Mike Tyson's a legend I told you I got you in just came a little late oh oh [ __ ] no way signed by the B for me it's a representation of Jordan because he's a Fighter fighting through what he's doing and obviously Mike Tyson is one of the most legendary Fighters so it's actually pretty cool to have boxing gloves signed directly from him all right guys so trade update we just left the gym right now trade update is currently 12:30 in the afternoon so like I mentioned earlier if that daily candlestick closes under that previous structure level we're pretty much going to set and forget this [ __ ] for a very long time 4 hours looking good we are now currently up about $1,200 on the account so I'm going to continue to set them forget I think I was already about like $1,200 1,300 bucks and I had a decision to make I can either close there and hit my takeprofit for the week or I can logically look at the markets and realize that my analysis and my strategy is indicating to me that this trade is going to have a much higher risk reward ratio so what would I do the whole reason of me entering a trade is to capitalize the most I can from the gains all right guys trade update it is currently 3 17 in the afternoon and we are up about 1,600 on the trade and you guys can see here that the market is about to close you guys can hear that the market is about to close in 2 hours so this daily Candlestick will close about an hour 42 minutes and it's honestly going a lot faster than I anticipated and we're definitely going to close under that previous structure level this is why you set and forget your take profit you never put a take profit you always put a stop loss to minimize your losses you never put a take profit you never want to minimize your losses so this trade we just continue to hold and set and forget and this is where I'm preaching to all of my students I'm actively monitoring the markets seeing how much more can we continue to go in One Direction because I'm a pro Trend Trader I trade with all the time frames in my favor so the trade continues to go in that direction on the long run you want to trade with the trend the trend is your friend so in here is where I continue to set and forget and analyze the markets and the trade went from 1,000 in profit to 2,000 currently up about $1,600 on the account so we're up $22,000 to$ 3,000 God damn wow bro wow how long did it take you last year to do this this is probably almost a month last year that shows you how much better of a Trader I've become I'm so much less attached to the profits and of the money behind this bro that's crazy dude and keep in mind goal for the week was 900 so if I close at this point I'm ahead by 6 weeks in the challenge cutting the end goal of turning the 100 into the million to then maybe then two months so at this point I'm [ __ ] hyped so then I was we like halfway through the week I'm basically living my normal life drifting um going out to the gym just doing whatever I got to do I realized that you know what 3K more than enough I can see the trade that it can potentially have a reversal because the structure is starting to shift so I close my profits there guys see right here that the account is at officially $3,000 you guys can see here on my fbook pretty much uh where we started the account with the current balance updated two days ago you guys can see here the history these are all the trades that we have taken obviously two trades on GBP JPY one trade on usdjpy and I did not take any more trades for the week on week two because I'm well past the profit that I need there's no reason on me to go chase and add new trades so I simply said and forget and then we pulled up to the next week where then the goal is to take 3K to 6K last week we turned $437 into $3,000 same thing as always getting on Sunday swings analyzing the markets with my students finding the top two top three markets that I'm going to be trading with that very week then my goal is to take 3K to 6K and at this point in the challenge where I'm at 3K I no longer have to risk 100% of the account cuz one I'm already ahead by 4 weeks and my goal once I get to about 3 to 5K is to minimize my risk on the account to about 50 to 75% meaning if I take a losing trade I don't start back at zero at least I still have some ammunition to then kick back and get started right where I was for the profit that I should be for that week so in my mindset technically yes I did lose some time but I lost time that I gained not time that I where I should actually be in the challenge so for example let's say I took a loss on the 3K account and I'm go back to the 900 well it's technically where I'm supposed to actually be for the challenge for that so it gives me the freedom to be able to actually do that because I'm so ahead in the challenge all right guys so market update it is currently 9:49 in the morning we are officially in the trade so I literally entered let me before that let me show you guys the time right so what time is it right now in Miami I come over here I refreshed the website 9:49 in the morning so literally to show you guys we just entered the trade so look pull up here so you guys remember how I literally just mentioned that we were going to have a pull back into this level to then sell so we literally had that pull back perfectly I went exactly to where I I didn't go exactly to where I anticipated but got really close I entered it and just to show you guys proof I was just recording for Instagram right now as soon as we enter the trade we're literally like using margin and [ __ ] because we enter the trade pretty much risked everything so I just wanted to show you guys that but now we're officially in the trade we are up $400 on it currently right now like always have to show you guys that it is a real account so you guys can see right here that it is indeed a real account you guys can see where the account is currently sitting and we're currently now going to just wait but I explained to you guys perfectly this I explained to you guys the break and retest here I entered at this next retest where we should have waited for it here should have waited for the break and retest here to then sell but then this didn't happen here but it did happen here we then entered after the engulfing which ideally we should be entering up here so then on week three we started off with a new trade that we took and we pretty much went straight into draw down about 50% draw down in the account which is totally fine I'm okay with it I don't mind the swings but I continue to set and forget and then the trade and the trend ended up going in the favor where I ended up analyzing and then the trade actually went back into profit we're about 5,000 floating in profit keep in mind my goal for the week is actually 6,000 and like always I'm updating my telegram Discord Instagram every like I'm Mass Social Media Blasting these trades everywhere so I'm not the only person that's in profit or in loss like there's hundreds of thousands of Traders all around the world looking at the same Market that I am people in Africa people in London people in the States going through the same Journey that I'm going through because if I'm making money you're making money but if I'm losing money you're losing money too and I always have this belief that in order for you to receive you have to give so I'm at this point in the challenge where I need to receive I got to make back some of these profits I'm like you know what let me give my boy Sensei a little gift a m Blanc pen one of 10 in the world so this is a very special edition watch so this is a muham mad Ali M Blan watch so you see it has like Ali through here and then you see the Muhammad Ali everywhere throughout here see the Muhammad Ali everywhere through here pen was like $3,000 I don't even think this guy appreciated that [ __ ] but you know what I don't care because when I go look at my trade that same night we were up about $9,000 on the account so right now we are currently floating about $6,000 in profit the account is currently at $9,000 in equity and you guys can see this trade right here is literally continuing the momentum to the downside just continuing the set and forget Trend that's why you got to trade with the trend the trend is your friend so you guys can see the 4our close very strong I am going to just continue to hold this trade uh if tomorrow closes under this line right here not this one I'm just copying facing if the Candlestick closes under this line right there we will probably turn this into over $115,000 easily so let's wait for now simply just set and forget so if you want to receive something first you got to get and I actually put this to test later throughout the journey and it came back 10 times more so a little bit more on that later in the journey and then the usual happened every single time you set and forget the trade ended up going to $5,000 bucking dollars 15,500 so exactly what I was mentioning to you guys earlier I have to see like you can't just close a trade right away right cuz you got to look so obviously we're going to close a trade because we wanted it to close under this line or under this right here and actively looks like we are piercing through that so this Candlestick closes in the next 5 minutes as you can see right over here and if this Candlestick closes under this line it will mean that it closes under this structure point and then there I truly do believe that it could then easily go from here to then this point right here so right now we literally got to wait the next 5 minutes if it closes above like that I'm going to close it right then and there if not I'll squeeze it in for the little bit extra right here just to show you guys we're up about 15,100 right now [ __ ] bro Trace set are reversing on me dude look at this Bro [ __ ] Trace set are reversing we were up like 15 here and now bro like I said forget too much bro like we Clos the trade like 2 hours ago so right now it's currently 12:30 in the afternoon right here you guys can see where the account is it's officially closed at $115,000 you guys can see right here in the history so you guys can see that we officially closed this trade at $122,200 in profit so we closed it earlier literally as soon as I told you guys pretty much after it closed that line so it did make it all the way up to this structure point and then it had a reaction so pretty much exactly what I explained it's going to have a reaction from that structure point right here and if we follow this line it's exactly what it did so our entry points are as precise as they get our stop losses our take profit everything with the S fre strategy [ __ ] sniper yo the goal for the week was 6 grand we are at $115,000 so if we were to close at six grand this week the goal for next week was to turn 6 to 12 so we just did this week and next week's goal oh [ __ ] we should go on a vacation right ahead of schedule we should just [ __ ] off for two weeks right keep in mind I'm looking at the numbers on the screen because you guys like to see it I hate looking at the metatrader and the money go up and down I hate it it [ __ ] with your mind I only like looking at the charts because what happens in the charts directly correlates with what's happening on the numbers what happens on the numbers does not mean that that affects the charts the charts affects the numbers I only like looking at the charts because I can make a logical decision based off of the price action I can't make a logical decision based off of me being up 5,000 or 6,000 what connection does that have to the charts zero so I started implementing that and educating people on it and they everybody kind of had like a oh and AA moment they're like oh you know what that does make sense I should only look at the charts and not the numbers because if you focus on the structure structure the structure is going to equal the money this is like the prime where I was in the challenge in terms of ahead like I had so much time ahead of what I anticipated to have that I felt like the king of the world at this point so we ended off week three closing at about $155,000 in profit where then the goal for next week was to then take the 15K to then 30k it's week four of me turning $100 into a Million last week we were trying to turn $3,000 up to $6,000 now the next week actually started off kind of slow no trades towards the beginning of the week so we kind of just had fun gym drift uh I think I bought a dope art piece from Atlanta Atlanta just pulled up so Atlanta just did a collab with Trump where he pulled up he actually signed one of the paintings that he did I actually have a bunch of Atlanta paint throughout my whole entire house but I just got two new posters going to give one to one of my family members are all about Trump and I want to put one on the walk CU I think is a legendary ass picture and then ARA did it herself let's go Che it out oh [ __ ] so this K's in a frame yeah yeah you got the first two literally the first two oh so that's that's basically where he signed it on the on the original yeah but this that's my signature oh okay so yeah but he sign it like somewhere there exactly yeah okay so oh wait so this is one out of 47 yeah one and that's two and then two out of 47 oh [ __ ] so I got the real oh [ __ ] appreciate you bro this lit so for people that don't know I was the first person that trusted arlanta pain Lambo yo lamb for real yo the first one it's crazy he hit me up he was like yo I'm going to do Art Basel I was at 2020 2022 2022 so y I want I want to paint your Lambo on Art B and I'm like dog I don't know a little crazy I'm like you know what [ __ ] it let's do two Lambo we did my hood and then Sensei is whole oh yeah the yeah I remember that mhm then we do the rose the dawn oh yeah that's right the Don look I you know I have this painting oh the Kobe yeah Dam I haven't seen this one in a minute yeah yeah Jordan gifted me this one yeah I remember that but then the unexpected happened well kind of expected because I started getting bored in the challenge I'm so ahead I feel like Superman I'm winning every trade I'm ahead by four five weeks I feel like I can take any trade so the market wasn't giving me prot Trend trades meaning having markets to have every single time frame in the favor to trade with and there was just nothing available that checked out everything in my trading plan I had to do something togenerate take trades that I shouldn't be taking all right guys markets update so I spent the morning kind of just focusing locking in diving on this trade to see if I was making the right decision because we have officially taken most of the generate trade of the whole entire [ __ ] challenge the biggest counter Trend trade it's such a Degen trade that I did not risk 100% I risked 20% on this trade so just show you guys currently market update and we are negative about $500 cuz we literally just entered the trade as the Candlestick just closed right now so yesterday on Euro USD I'm sure you guys can remember that I was anticipating for price to have a sell from this point up here to then reject and then for price to actually make it all the way down here to then have the actual Buy on EUR USD because we're anticipating for Euro USD to make it all the way down here reject this level and then head to the upside since we broke out we never retested it so we are expecting for that retest and here on the 1 hour you can very very clearly see that we are creating a potential left head right shoulder again it's not a confirmed right shoulder until we don't break under this neckline but I believe what it's creating right here it's such a strong level of accumulation looks like a 1 hour double top 30 minute time frame I see it I almost see it like squeezing into this inwards uh triangle whatever you want to call this again I hate trend lines and I hate all this stuff cuz they're very subjective but you can literally see how price is squeezing into this area and I personally believe it's going to have more of a reason to burst down than burst up I could be completely wrong because I don't believe that this area that is rejecting from right now is going to be the area to continue pushing to the upside I think such a strong move like this has to have a deeper retracement before actually heading to the upside so when I go down to the 4our this 4our Candlestick still has about 3 hours to close and the last one closes a very indecisive candle I think this next one can engulf close under this which then on the 1 hour it'll give us the break under this neckline of The Head and Shoulders if you notice I put my stop loss a little bit right above this level because if we pretty much break Above This the trade is just going to keep going to the upside oh that that doesn't seem very good I'm not good I mean I called it you know I don't really care um I'm glad that I ended up getting that out of my system I'm a [ __ ] idiot bro like I mean technically we're still in the trade right so it could clearly reject this level right here so it can literally have the same reaction to the downside and then this same reaction to the downside that's why I'm very strategic with my stop- loss basement but the trade that I should be taking is at the break and retest from the neck line of The Head and Shoulders like I know this I I know this you know I just decided to want to get involved but I'm not mad there's a really set us back much in the challenge there's an unnecessary loss well not a loss yet but it's just a trade update so it's just like an hour later from the last time that we took the trade so yeah now we just got to wait and this is what a lot of you guys do a lot of you guys do this a lot of you guys will take trades that you shouldn't be taking but you guys won't put the blame on yourself or hold yourself accountable I know exactly what I did I did the wrong thing now do I accept it 100% you guys when you do the wrong things you don't accept it you're ready to put the to blame on on someone's strategy on the markets on anything but yourself that's what once you start having that self-recognition is once you start developing a nonchalant character for trading in the markets and that's how you truly become successful because you realize that your success whatever the outcome is successful or not is 100% because of you not because of another Outsource like I'm the one that clicked the sell button the phone didn't click it just for me you know so for now that a foret can't do this yo that's a sign that we shouldn't we took the first [ __ ] loss in the 100 to The Middle [Music] [Applause] come [ __ ] man and um yeah first loss in the challenge and I said you know what this loss isn't because of my strategy my strategy works there was just no opportunities that week that align with my strategy I decided to be a slick ass wanted to be smart and take trades that I shouldn't because I was bored because I felt like I was Superman and this is the week where I decided to implement a punishment every single time I break my trading plan I then have to do something in order so I hold myself accountable because again there's hundreds of thousands of people watching these videos uh following all the trades making money with me losing money with me and I don't mind losing money if I am following my trading plan but if I'm breaking my trading plan I do mind losing money because I shouldn't not be doing that I should only lose money when I follow my trading plan so whenever I don't follow my trading plan there has to be a punishment and that's where the beetle came in I have owned Lamborghinis ferari Porsches rolls-royces McLaren McLaren bro McLaren how can I forget about that but this right here is going to put the biggest smile on my face the biggest don't just yet this right here is my new masterpiece yes bro perfect perfect oh yeah we're getting a haircut on Thursday night instead of tomorrow we always get a haircut Friday morning we're getting one tonight cuz Eric is not available [Music] the [ __ ] is that what do you mean bro what is that [ __ ] my new car you don't like it that's fake that's thing just park up Park up let me let me explain to you guys the real moral behind this car right here so this is so I follow my trading plan and my trading rules obviously I have a [ __ ] ton of cool cars but this is going to Humble me every single time I break my trading plan this week I have broken my trading plan twice meaning every single time I break my trading plan I cannot drive any of my cars for 24 hours the only car that I can drive is this for 24 hours so what is that going to incentivize me to do to not break my trading plan every single time I break my trading plan I have to drive this for 24 hours that's just the price and the consequence that I have to pay what do you think you [ __ ] with it t stuff and it's manual it is yes four it's fourspeed well you going to drift it that's just 1966 oh sensei's here give me a you don't like it no sorry hey hey hey hey you like it we're going to be blessed if we get a [ __ ] whiff of air in that no air bik oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] all right all right all right oh we out oh dud it's not that bad at all oh this is fantastic oh y bar has my god oh it has no brakes that thing is leaning boy is it leaking no leaning leaning leaning what way like this really hey follow your trading plan if not you're going to be like me oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] [Music] [ __ ] Beetle and I leave so much by example that I went to go do some student podcast with students that have made over $100,000 with my strategy and instead of me pulling up in a superar and taking them for a cool Journey as I normally do I pulled up in the beetle even the students were making fun of me cuz because they expect for me to pull up and show them the lifestyle and I show them the real lifestyle I broke my trading plans and I'm driving this piece of [ __ ] and I wanted to show it as an example to them like yeah all right cool my student made 100,000 but buddy I want to let you know you need to have something to hold you accountable how I am right now because if you don't you're going to probably end up driving a car like this so that's why I led by example and to show the students live in person that they need to continue to follow the trading plan to be successful the moment they don't they're going to end up in a car like that it's kind of a funny way to look at it but it's the reality of the situation this is where the humbling begins you guys know how much I love driving my Porche GT3 and driving it like a man and driving my Ferrari and driving it like a man but man's got to do what a man's got to do and a man's got to pay the price and I'm doing this show you guys I'm holding myself accountable for breaking my rules and as you guys can tell I've already attempted to drive this vehicle and uh today starts the 24-hour clock where I will only drive the beetle what name should we give the beetle keep in mind it's a 1966 Volkswagen Beetle it has the original engine four-speed transmission I tried turning it on earlier it did not work we're going to try again right now so this is to show you guys that I'm going back to my roots of me literally having to hold myself accountable when I do something wrong I don't want to do this but if I don't follow my tra plan I will no longer be able to drive a [ __ ] Ferrari or a Porsche I'm going to probably be driving some [ __ ] like this so I'm going to keep following my trading plan so I don't end up in a [ __ ] car like this please turn [Music] on what name should we give it should it be a he should it be a her come on come on work my way up watch what do you guys know about this what profit of Trader knows how to do this [Music] [Music] [Music] all right yeah we only got space for two oh oh yeah let's just push it let's push it so we ended off on week four with the first loss that we had in the whole entire challenge so this was a big uppercut to my ego because at to this point I felt invisible I literally felt like I could do anything I could win every single trade it's week five of me trying to turn $100 into a million day trading last week we ended up taking two unnecessary losses because I broke my trading plan so we started off the challenge with about 8,000 which is where we left off last week because cuz we took the account from 15 to 8,000 so at this point in the challenge I am not scared to execute a position I'm being a little bit more selective so I actually avoided some wins that I could have taken but I also avoided a couple of losses that I could have taken and funny enough because some of my friends were actually calling me in the middle of the week saying hey you going to get enter this and enter this I'm like no dude trust me I'm not going to enter these counter Trend trades I don't want to drive the [ __ ] Beetle my God what the [ __ ] oh wow just saw this right now so nzdusd I'm actually laughing because one of my friends called me earlier he's like yo what should I do with nzdusd I entered earlier this week Sunday night when you sent it out on Sunday studing this one of my friends that I went to high school with literally one of the only close friends that I have outside of you know my my team and he told me he's like yo should I close nzdusd or do I hold I'm like dude if you hold it can have the risk of having a pool back I don't think you should hold I think you should close he's like nah no no no I'm going to set him forget I'm like brother you have to know when to set him forget and when to not set him forget this is not the time you don't want to like not close this trade and I'm laughing cuz I know he is I know I'm going call him I'm going call him yes so I'm not friend I'll call you a 100 times I don't give a [ __ ] yo yo you're sleeping to have you seen your trade yeah [ __ ] you bro [ __ ] me I told you bro you tell me to have a pullback not a whole [ __ ] move straight down that's what I told you bro I told you I was going to have a pullback bro you don't [ __ ] listen to me dog what are you think D you told me S forget no no no no no no no no no I told you don't set him forget this trade it's going to have a pullback you didn't listen to me bro Y no no I literally told you bro I'm like yo it's going to it's going to have the pullback so week five we actually did not end up taking any trades at all we did a lot of action stuff I went to go look at a new Penthouse that I was looking to move into the Bugatti that I bought my pink Bugatti we got delivery of it with Jane juice which is another successful student of mine from the 30-day boot camp so I bought a new car so you yeah you don't know what car about right you don't no all right you're about to know in a little bit so I was going to say something and say some words with courage but all I have to say is set and forget that's all I got to say you think bro I have no words to say honestly and it's you're the only one that knows bro no no no I I I'm speechless honestly I'm not going to say anything I I I'll leave it for you guys to see it where he has made over a quar million dollars in trading in under 6 months he got into my first boot camp at the beginning of the year and then later throughout 6 months after applying everything he learned in the strategy he made more than A4 million dollar I find out out I'm like dude pull it to Miami let's do a podcast you know I like to show traders that if they apply the strategy and they do everything the right way the lifestyle that they want it's just couple moves away all you have to do is execute the strategy correctly so later throughout the week just more day-to-day action in my life and we did not take any trades so keep in mind the week before this we ended up taking our first loss then the week after this which week five we ended up taking no traits which kind of made me feel a little bit not like Superman anymore cuz at the beginning of the challenge I felt Invincible now this times I'm getting a little bit more humbled and being very selective on the type of Trades that I'm taking because obviously I don't want to blow the account now I'm so ahead I have so much time in front of me that I want to be on track to complete the challenge it's week six of me turning $100 into a million and let me tell you you guys aren't ready for this week then we started off week six at same exact balance the only difference now is that we have a Bugatti in the front of the driveway now we got views of my [ __ ] Bugatti so if I don't complete this challenge I can't afford the Bugatti so I definitely have to complete the challenge and stay on Route so the goal doesn't feel right right the Bugatti's pink I'm wearing blue I'll be right back give me a second more like it huh got to be on the same Vibe as a bro I cannot believe I [ __ ] did that dude still surreal what's the payment on one of those my payment is 46,000 a month and then the insurance is like 2500 so it comes out to like 48 49,000 every month so yeah we got a lot of work to do to make that up and to start off the week like always we do the Sunday swings we pick the top two top three markets for the week ahead but I decided to go look at my track record on the trades that I'm taking in the account to look at the stats like what am I doing right what am I doing wrong so I can learn from it and double down on what I'm doing right and F what I'm doing wrong currently we have taken the 100 bucks to $88,000 you guys can see that the starting balance was 100 bucks and it was just updated 44 minutes ago down below over here you can currently see our win rate is currently a 70% of the total amount of Trades that we have taken we taken a total seven amount of Trades and 100% of our trades have been short we have not taken any long positions and our average duration is an interesting 20 hour now this right here is going to be a problem very soon the commissions that we have on the account because the bigger obviously we start scaling on this challenge the more slippage the more commission everything that we're it's going to cost us to trade so I might be switching Brokers very very soon not entirely sure just yet but I will be letting you guys know if I do well I don't Market a broker I'm just going to let you guys know if I switch to a broker I don't plan to Market any broker anytime soon you know what's funny I paid $2,000 for that lighter it doesn't work now I have to use this $20 what is it how much I don't even know how much is this like $5 at a gas station [ __ ] sucks it just doesn't feel right lighting a good cigar with a $5 lighter from a gas station feel like I'm disrespecting the cigar $2,000 on a lighter GBP CHF probably one of the cleanest ones that you can probably see and it is this beautiful higher high higher low higher high higher low higher high higher low higher high boom shift the structure lower low lower high low or low now this time frame is bearish now if I just show you guys this Market structure like this which is realistically how you have to look at the structure of the market not look at the market this right here is the structure of the market and you can clearly see how we were creating higher highs higher lows then we shifted we did a ginormous and beautifully formated double top pattern right here and now we're coming back to retest that neckline of the double top to then have a reaction to the downside would have coincidence that the neckline of the double top happens to also be at the weekly EMA and also happens to have a round psychological level 1.1 to 500 which is obviously very key because now you just have three four things that simply make sense at this area and order for you to be interested in the trade what a coincidence now we also have the daily EMA we also have daily structure level so on and so forth so what I'm going to be waiting for for this trade is for price to have a break and retest under this little double top formation that we're potenti potentially creating at this area here so I have an alarm right at the bottom of it that's going to notify me as soon as we break out of it and this trade once it does that it's going to have a great risk reward we can easily get a 1 to five or even to this structure point and then obviously we have a smaller stop loss we get like a 1 to six 1 to six or 7 this is a great risk reward on this trade because we are following the trend we're trading with the weekly time frame we're trading with the daily time frame and once that double top breaks we're going to be trading with the 4our time frame so we have three time frames are going all in the same direction simply just enter the trade set and forget so after we analyzed the top markets for the week like always on Sunday swings we then realized there was no markets to trade but then we got a phone call from this guy that was like yo you want to put your Bugatti in a music video with Kodak Black and Trump they want to have your the Bugatti um in this warehouse and have this marching Trump's marching band behind it playing while Kodak and all them are rapping in front of but Trump will be there I I mean I've been part of a couple music videos I know how this [ __ ] goes you know start pull up at 3: start at 700 end at 1 in the morning you know bro I [ __ ] hope it's not like that like [ __ ] yeah I've been listening to codak Black since I was like 15 and who doesn't like Trump little did I know that I was getting scammed Trump was not pulling up and Kodak Black pulled up 20 hours late and that same night my Bugatti broke Kodak not here yet we'll probably be here in like 30 minutes we gonna leave till like 3 in the morning watch my b wait hold on hold on hold on hold I'm not going to lie this ship feels a little too [Music] wobbly we are still here 9:00 a.m. basically a trade update and we're still here well after a couple hours finally got it up now we got to take it from this tow truck to that tow truck [ __ ] this dude I don't even want to talk about that so after we finished all those Shenanigans like always patience pace and most importantly following the set and fre strategy GBP CHF as you guys can see we're currently up about $6,000 so we entered this trade earlier literally probably like [ __ ] I don't know like an hour ago but we're in the middle of all these Cs and the trade is now heading into our Direction everything's looking very well we're actually in a lot more profit than I expected obviously I did not account how volatile this pair is I did not realize that if this pair goes into a little bit more draw down we'll blow this account completely cuz this pair is super volatile I actually have not entered a trade in GP CHF in a very long time but this trade right here if it does hit my takeprofit it could take account up to like $70,000 if it does make it all the way down here and then we were up now from the $88,000 that we were technically down back up to the 15,000 where we were two weeks ago so now we're picking back up staying on track and the goal for this week was to turn the 8,000 to 16,000 or 18,000 roughly and again I had an executive decision to make do I close at the profit for the week or do I set him forget what do you think I did I [ __ ] said and forget drum roll please $38,000 Ching well Fair now I think this trade is that's why I'm not even that excited because I do think this trade right now in London session is going to have a pullback let me show you so I think now this is will have a retracement to retest this neckline of the left head right shoulder for then the trade to then head to the downside currently on the daily time frame we close very strong as a bearish and engulfing but we could come back and retest these daily Wicks right here so then the trade can continue heading to the downside now this is where a lot of beginner Traders will probably get you know fomo and either close out their positions here or they can probably set and forget the whole entire weight currently just waiting for it to do its thing but then when we go close the trade we get the most ridiculous slippage I have ever gotten in any trading account and I said if I'm getting slipp at this part in the challenge so early on I don't want to be with this broker anymore yo we just blew the whole [ __ ] account no that's how you closed the trade bro we literally just blew the whole account like we just withdraw the money so we just draw the money from the current broker should get into my wallet by the end of today maybe tomorrow and uh we're going to deposit into to a new broker which I might be letting you guys soon which broker it's going to be so you guys are going to have the same market conditions as me current broker right now the fees were all over the price the commissions were okay it was more of the slippage I would literally try and close a trade out and I get slipped out I wouldn't get close at the point that I wanted to so I'm going to be switching to a new broker today pretty much and uh we'll see where the challenge goes from that point and this is why I don't Market Brokers right at the beginning of the challenge I know you guys asked me for what broker am I using what broker am I using I literally got this ass a thousand times I don't want to Market a broker that I don't trust and I don't have any experience with and gladly I did Market it because [ __ ] I close a trade at 30,000 in profit and then it puts me at 22 the slippage and the spread was absolutely ridiculous I decided to withdraw my money and then put it into a new broker that I was going to then test out but again keep in mind this is the exact same account that I then just transferred the funds into a different one and this is where we then pretty much moved on to week number seven where the ending bance is about 22,000 it's week seven of me turning this $100 into a million so then on this next week it was week seven we were starting wor about 22,000 and then the goal was to take 22 to then 40 touch that touch that what you guys know about week seven turning $100 into a million I I I thought I had just reversed on so I was like oh [ __ ] currently right now we are up $4,000 on the trade now I'm not excited because of these $4,000 I could give a [ __ ] I'm excited about the potential of this trade that we have taken if you have seen last week's series you saw the loss we avoided on this position price had the push stop then push that's what we are anticipating for this week to come ahead so we avoided not making any money this week simply because we have experience in the market now let's stick at it now so trade update we are currently up $4,000 on GBP CHF so if you guys saw last night's trade update I explained that I was looking to enter a trade right around this area once we had the retest to them s So currently right now GBP CHF has a very strong double top formation currently creating right now very strong bearish move if this trade hits all the way down here we [ __ ] sweep 1 to 11 risk to reward meaning we will take right now we have 35 Lots right so 35 Lots means that it's $350 per pip so we do $350 per pip times a take profit of $342 Pips so $350 time 342 Pips drum roll please $100,000 in AEK one single position the beauty of this is not this we're going to get to this no matter what what is the beauty is how much I'm actually putting at risk so I'm only putting at risk so we have 30 pip stop loss so if I do 350 per pip times $30 I'm only putting at risk 50% of the account this is key to growth so I'm literally risking 50% to almost 5x the account tell me that's not a [ __ ] great deal so as right now we are currently just waiting for this position to have a confirmation body Candlestick closure in the next 27 minutes under this level of support right here 4our Candlestick looks very strong very bearish engulfing can then wait for a little retest as well for then that structure level right there basically more of the story all we got to do right now is set forget just looks so lovely dude like we're finally like making some type of decent money like look at this and then we ran into the same broker issue we took the 20 and then we took it to the 40 but we ran into even worse slippage on this other broker that we were testing out and again this is why I don't Market Brokers it's my first time trading on it and I'm taking a good trade and when I take it the profits that I'm supposed to be making I literally lost it because of the slippage on the account this is the trades from last night GBP CHF you guys can clearly see that we closed out all three positions at the same exact time one of them is in profit and then the other got split in half or whatever and then it was in a loss so GBP CHF last night I explained if we had a retest of this level and then a rejection to the downside we can very easily continue to head down if not if we body close above we can come back right into our area of Interest so we body closed above and as I'm seeing this body close above and then I'm seeing this rejection from the EMA but then I see this retest of this level of support that every single time we're above we're clearly heading up I say oh [ __ ] this is the area where I want to get out because I could get pushed right back into my entry and I don't want to be in a loss at this point in the challenge I'm doing so well so decided to close my position right at that line right there right at 1.11 1282 right at 3:00 in the morning 4: in the morning which is like when London session is kicking in you guys can see down here the times and I closed out the first position right the 20 Lots so the 20 Lots gave me $2,000 in profit now we're we're going to do some calculations right now because if I enter the position up at this point right here and then we close out the position let's say somewhere in here that is a total of about 23 Pips but for argument sake let's say 20 Pips so I am currently risking $200 per pip so it's going to be $200 time 20 Pips I'm supposed to be up $4,000 on that position I am up $2,000 so they ate up 50% of my profits but that's fine you know what high fees I'll take it whatever not a big deal but then the other position when I go close it it is then in a loss why did I take a loss on the same position that I entered at the same spot and closed at the same spot why did it close at a loss now this is where I get very skeptical about these platforms because it's just so unnecessary like like I just I just don't get it and this is why I also split my lot sizes because everybody says oh why don't you just take 180 lot it's for this very same exact reason if I were to take 80 Lots in a position it would literally have one full slipped out position versus if I split the positions in half at least I get one and then the other ones probably have a little bit of slippage so I I do this because I've dealt with this ship before and I've been dealing it for a very long time like this at this point was very frustrating because I just came off of a losing week then a break even week and now two weeks that are technically Break Even because of the market conditions that the broker was giving me if I'm running into these issues with a broker so early on into the challenge I'm already being skeptical because imagine the slippage and the issues that I'm going to be running at when I'm fluctuating hundreds of thousand doar in profit which is realistically like 3 4 weeks away if I double the account every single week it's week eight of me turning $100 into a Million last week we took two trades where one of them made us about $2,000 and then the other we lost a $22,000 biggest waste of time ever and I wasn't going to let any of this broker issue stop me living my life I'm going to go drift my Porsche I'm going to go hit the gym I'm going to go do what I have to do because at the end of the day What affected me last time was that I was not living my normal life now this time I decided to you know you know what if I take a loss if I take a win I'm going to go hit my gym I'm going to go take my my night trades if you know what I'm talking about and just do what I got to do and then later on throughout the week we got another great opportunity in the market which is what we analyze on Sunday swings this market right here currently is is having a lower high pullback and this is what this Market structure looks like on this pullback right we have some structure right here and then we are now at this resistance level if I take this same exact Market structure move from right here and then I simply move it to this Market structure here with an exception of making this a little bit higher and aiming this a little bit higher it's the exact same move right here but instead of it OB OB L being here it is now right here it's the same exact move with the exception of bit being a little bit higher now what is the difference that this had this [ __ ] the structure up here and that this one is having it right here let's see what happened here to see if we can anticipate for it to happen here cuz we're expecting for the cells and clearly this once it did this pattern it then went to the downside so let's zoom in to this 30 minutes structure on this circle time frame right here what did we get when we were at this pattern right here oh okay we got a left head right shoulder okay cool left head right shoulder retest then sell well let's go to current price right now holy [ __ ] what do we have here left head right shoulder [ __ ] with me [ __ ] with me if you want me to keep showing you guys cuz I see this all the time and I don't always explain it because I it's just normal to me this is my second language third language and I see this literally every single day it's very very normal to me but to a lot of you guys this might be like what the [ __ ] a wild moment and if it is let me know in the comments so I can keep doing this stuff for you guys cuz it motivates me and it shows me that you guys are actually learning so this position we're actually very very very interested in executing but not just yet I want to execute this position once we have some type of engulfing confirmation as of right now I have my potential entry right under this level because when this Candlestick closes under it it is a engulfing Candlestick so just put my alarm under there to pretty much notify me once we have that engulfing Candlestick even the 15minute hasn't had the engulfing quite just yet so we're going to stay up all night tonight because that literally might happen very very very soon we actually ended up taking then the account from the 22 to about 60k in profit more or less drum roll please what [ __ ] trade update $19,000 [ __ ] dollars in profit now what how fast did this happen very fast let me show you guys so right now USD JPY exactly how I explained yesterday we literally explained the only way we'd be interested in taking this position right here is if we have a break retest and then sell price literally broke retested sell exactly what we anticipated perfect entry signal literally 1 hour ago as you guys can see down here 8:00 in the morning currently right now it is 10:00 in the morning so as soon as we entered this position Market immediately started heading to the downside look how fast this momentum of this Market is currently moving beautiful 30 minutes bearish engulfing Evening Star formation 15minute time frame at soon as the Candlestick close boom just completely downside move which is absolutely beautiful this is the trade that we avoided yesterday and we avoided to take the loss cuz it never retested and gave us the engulfing of this this left head and the right shoulder now avoided this loss we can remove this now we have this position right here we're just looking decent right obviously I'm just hyped because I risked a lot more than I should have because we're trying to turn $20,000 into 40 so I can literally close the position right now and then we will have the $40,000 in profit that we need literally oh oh [ __ ] oh oh oh what oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] just happened oh [ __ ] oh oh whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoa wo wo W whoo whoo wo don't you [ __ ] do it hold on I'm in the I'm in shock right now yo I saw 50,000 it was it was at the bottom of that Wick right there is news happening right now probably well now I'm on edge I'm going to put an alarm right around my entry signal just to let me know that it is up there I have to put a an alarm at the bottom of this Candlestick if we if we get a Candlestick to go back under that Wick we're pretty much good we are good okay time to foret you you don't want this all right so currently right now we had a little quick uh spazz in the markets this is what trading in the market is this is why people go crazy when they risk more money than they should if I was risking you know 3 4 5% like a normal human I would even care oh right now $40,000 floting and profit that's it I'll be care about oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] yo oh [ __ ] yo no yo yo I yo I can't make this up dude yo I can't make this up dude holy holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] bro yo stoping dude oh oh yo 100,000 yo there's no way yo there's no way yo yo there's no there's no way oh I kind of hurt myself is my watch okay yeah it's fine doesn't matter we can buy another one oh oh oh dude oh yo we're about to be at 100,000 that's [ __ ] crazy yo the countdown is legendary yo no no no no we got to keep going we got to keep going got to keep going we got to keep going 95 95 oh 97 yo it's going to hit 100,000 yo it's going to hit 100,000 we got to keep going look dude I think I think we got it to like dude do we got up to [Music] there now now I just got to focus what is it on I didn't do this this right here shows you guys that the [ __ ] fundamentals will follow the technicals all right I got to focus dude market update boys market update boys and ladies and gentlemen we have officially officially closed the accounts at no no no drum roll please thank you very much we have officially closed at 90,000 [ __ ] dollars on the account so we ended off the week I think about 90,000 80,000 something like that in profit and honestly I didn't have really anything else to do so I had a bright idea why not buy five six junk cars call my other rich friends and let's just go play bumper cars [Music] [Music] [ __ ] so we ended off closing off the week with about 90,000 I think in profit and playing bumper cards which is pretty legendary because I got a pretty big group of people together in under two hours like imagine you getting a phone call saying yo pull up to this location and let's play bumper cars everybody's reaction is like what the [ __ ] good morning ladies and gentlemen as much as I would want to go right into the markets and show you my trades on this week where I'm going to be tearing the $990,000 200 I have to spoon feed my children my very special unique children that haters come here come here airplane so the beginning of week nine something that I expected to happen happened the haters the haters decided to arise and they decided to then voice their opinions on their challenge now keep in mind haters were not voicing their opinion up to this point why because the account wasn't big enough turning 100 to 300 and then 300 to 4 5,000 is just not exciting but now when I started having multiple six figures fluctuating automatically people wanted to then say he's not showing the trade history it's not real he blew the account like if I have not been showing every single trade the before the during the after up to this point literally showing every single trade in my free Telegram in my Discord in my Instagram on YouTube they wanted to voice their opinions and I said okay you know what nobody's going to [ __ ] with my reputation my reputation's everything so I addressed the haters showed the trade history and then continue on with the journey because truthfully if they were concerned about the challenge being legit at this point I said you know what thank you that means I'm not doing good of enough a job let me double down on making this even more transparent and even more legit ladies and gentlemen it is currently 11:15 in the morning and as of right now the account is currently sitting at a whopping you blew the account psych $15,000 now you know what let me just we're currently sitting at $115,000 now the reason why I'm not excited is because we could have literally been in this much profit we've been holding the last trade but sucks so we have to overexpose ourselves but it's okay why because the strategy is working once again nzdcad literally having left head right shoulder retest of the neckline exactly what I explained sh on the 1 hour time frame higher high higher low higher high once it breaks and retests this neckline we will be interested in selling and boys that is exactly what we did we broke and we retested once again like does not get any more legit than this oh but you want to know what's the crazy part that the downside potential of this trade is massive we can reach lows of all the way up to this structure point right here but we're not going to do that we're not going to be greedy we're going to be real second set real take profits and we entered this position once we body Clos under this right here we're pretty much good and very ironically the same week that I call out the haters is the same week where I'm supposed to be fluctuating in multiple six figures and profits actually ended up having the biggest loss I don't even know why I'm laughing at this point we blew the account boys to 44,000 [ __ ] bro this is why we can't [ __ ] around talking [ __ ] we [ __ ] jinxed it talking [ __ ] so we just took a unnecessarily $40,000 loss on ndd CAD the same week I decided to troll the haters which honestly it was kind of funny because I made it even more legit even more transparent and I expected to win a trade and I lost I lost in front of everybody and after I trolled the haters which kind of like a it was an L on my side but you know what I'm glad I'm glad that that happened because that only Made Me Stronger to then come into the next week so we started off the challenge this week on about 990,000 and we ended off on 40 which kind of sucks because after you address haters you want to win you want to win on the haters I lost on the haters even though we did lose 50% of the account I did something the haters can't I got on a G4 to go to Dominican Republic to not only do a podcast on the jet but to go check out my tobacco farm that I have for this brand that I'm actually building which is my new cigar brand and I said okay I might have lost for the week but let's take this private jet this cool podcast and be back in about 36 hours just to check up on how the cigars are doing and coming right back so the haters had to laugh at the beginning of the week but then I had it at the end of the week all right ladies and gentlemen good morning let's head to our office let me show you the starting balance for this week on the account wrong phone right phone so right now the starting balance for this week is going to be $444,000 so to start off week 10 we got on the Jet right back to Miami but before I leave I like taking care of the people that took care of me while we're out in this trip in Dominican Republic had one of the best chefs one of the best Services T them about $2 $3,000 in ones that I happened to find in my duffel bag don't ask me why it's ones don't ask me how it got there I don't know [Applause] you know what's funny you give like you can give somebody in the United States $10,000 like cash like a big stack like this and they'll be like thanks like they won they won't give a [ __ ] first thing that I do when I get back is put up the time piece trading buy a new Richard Mill cuz I felt like my wrist was a little weak you know I'm like you know what we've been doing this for 10 weeks I need some motivation I need something better Bugatti is not enough and it's broken let's go buy a new Rich M so what you just picked up it's limited to 50 pieces in the world it's the Asia Edition it's carbon super light I think it's cool like it's good contrast from your like your white watch your gold watch you know what makes this like the Asia Edition the the color way oh like the black and black gold bro I like this one I think I'm going take this one that's it easy to sell to this guy Bro [ __ ] it why not we bought a chain for Ste would do it we gave give away out to him cuz you're always giving back you know what the [ __ ] going on a good back you know he never gets gifts so I was like let me be the first guy to actually gift this guy something he's always giving other people stuff and I thought it was a nice gesture he doesn't need it probably got the chain throws it into a safe and never licks at it ever again but my conscious it's good we are currently in a position that we are going to continue to set and forget I mean I literally just called it last night it's not my first time calling it all right boys so market update we are currently up 41,000 so we're back at we're not even back where we were last week and we just did the dumbest thing ever we just executed a loss right here because we decided to enter this position right around this area thinking that it was just going to continue to go down like when you don't sleep all night you just start seeing [ __ ] but then I go down to the 1 hour I'm like but wait this price definitely has the opportunity to come back and retest this level of support and resistance just how it did here it could even go up further it could literally go back up all the way up to this area right around here before actually going down so the 80 lot that I took at that point right there I simply closed it cuz it was actually [ __ ] so now I currently in this position um literally what I said yesterday we're ready to execute it we're just waiting for the right confirmations we just got the break of the structure how I wanted to enter the EMA and yeah we're in this position now so I'm just going to anticipate for price to continue having a push to the downside after this retest uh we avoided a loss yesterday on Euro GBP avoided a loss on GBP JPY and avoided a loss on Euro AUD so we've been dodging bullets all week finally managed to catch one that allign with the strategy we closed the position at the top of this Wick up here and literally we probably did the best decision we could have done we closed these two positions at a $2,000 loss for a total of 160 Lots then we waited for price to have its rejection now some of you guys would have been like wow you closed for no reason you could have still been holding the trade you know what you're right you're right dude but you wouldn't be up $63,000 if I did not do that why because I waited for this next entry bearish engulfing confirmation uh Evening Star formation under the EMA rejection from the structure and I said you know what okay fine you want to take me out of break even and you want to make me lose an extra 15 Pips from the original entry that I originally had up here from this to this point okay fine I'll make it back by risking 170 more Lots on this position before we had 160 Lots which was these positions right here 80 plus 80 is 160 you add all these up and we have 330 so we essentially almost doubled a little bit over the risk that we had before but we got an extra confirmation that we did not get here and you know what I [ __ ] with it because yeah we lose 15 pits from the entry but we gain 170 Lots it sucks on the short term but on the long term trust me it's going to pay off man dude how stressful dude these last couple of hours yes yes in profit like we weren't just up $70,000 [ __ ] dollar this shit's making me go crazy all right we just got out right now at [ __ ] I don't know dude I don't even know how much that is um like $6,000 in profit 5,000 whatever bro what a swing dude how do you go from like 13 how do you go from $70,000 in profit to then $113,000 drw down to now only making 4 grand tell me how that works so we ended off week 10 pretty choppy kind of whack can't even lie because we spend a lot of money but we didn't make a lot of money but then come week 11 we do the same thing pick the top pairs for the week but now this time we did a major comeback welcome to week 11 trainning $100 into a million we made up for the slack that we did in 2 weeks because we took the account balance from what we were starting at to about $200,000 now you might be wondering what the [ __ ] the video just started it didn't the video started yesterday on Sunday swings welcome welcome welcome to another Sunday swings where I literally broke down every single one of these trades to the te I entered USD CAD on the sales once again so if you guys go watch last week's series you guys would see what I went through last week right here at this very moment I entered this trade got stopped out at break even I closed out of Break Even I entered this trade closed myself out of break even right here it was an absolute brutal Friday now price came back into the area did exactly what I said it was going to do and then we executed the positions right at the top of this area such a beautiful trade look at this retest here from this level of support support support resistance rejection from the EMA daily time frame currently having that re break of structure this daily Candlestick and golf 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 candlesticks then we had the pullback then we had the weekly double dogee rejection from the EMA rejection from the structure like there's so many things that are going to make this trade create a new lower low rather than create a higher high all I did was simply re-enter the trade where I was originally entered the only thing that changed is the mindset behind when I enter this trade versus when I entered this trade but if you notice I'm taking the the exact same tra look at the pattern formation here and where it is it's at the area of Interest EMA look at the pattern formation here it's at the area of interest and EMA and then you simply set and forgets and we are now up $168,000 and yes it's the same account as always boys you guys can see right here in the trade history we could like I can literally close this position right now so it's literally Monday morning and I can literally close out this position at this very point right here and be done for the week and there goes this series 10 5 minutes but you know what we're not stopping there we're going to keep it going we're going to try and turn this 100 something thousand into the million today now the goal for the week was to double the account and like always I see the structure continuing with the trend so I'm going to set and forget I want to maximize my profits but minimize my losses trade update it is currently 12:45 in the morning it's about to be 1:00 a.m. right now we are in a new position where now the account is up 35 gazillion dollars I'm kidding we're still at the same exact spot still no trades that we have added on to the challenge so we did miss this new added position on USD CAD as you guys can see pric has actually had a retracement to the area exactly how I anticipated price came back ret the structure level and now it looks like it's having a sell down we literally pulled out right I mean you know we had a little bit more that we could have potentially gotten but you know it's simply not worth it so we got out at the perfect area right before this retracement we're looking to add positions here but the session was not the right session to be entering this trade so for me to be interested in adding a new position I would have to wait for a retest here to then head to the downside so I'm going to be waiting for that lower high to then sell wake up the next day and I see the trade could have tripled the account I could have closed the account at half a million dollar by doing nothing and you know this did mess with my psychology a little bit but I'm leading by example I have too many people watching me I have to be realistic and be like you know what guys this is going to happen you're going to set and forget and you're going to close at the point where you thought it was the final point before price reversed but the trade keeps on going it's okay you made money you H your take profit you move on so I did miss out on about 300K on the trade but it's okay because I hit the profit for the week and we showed people that we can come back from two losing weeks two break evening weeks to now triple the account on one single trade it's week 12 of me turning this into a million day trading so on week 12 is where things start getting a little interesting because now every single trade we're about to take is going to fluctuate hundreds of thousands of dollars so like always the pairs that we analyze on Sunday swings ended up taking it we fluctuated up and down trade update I feel like I I feel like I've said this a million times trade update right now we are up5 $9,000 on the account but not only have I said this a million times I'm talking about this oh oh oh oh oh yo what is going on every single time yo what the [ __ ] yo it's every time dude yo I can't make this up dude yo I can't make this [ __ ] up bro I can't make this up bro I was literally going to say we have the head and shoulders pattern we see this pattern a gazillion times and then we usually always have the retest to then sell dude what is happening dude what is happening bro all right well look at that there goes our trade update right there we're up 100,000 they go for the week is half a ticket bro what's there come on do your thing and dude I was just so calm I was so relaxed I was so Pacific well the goal was to show you guys that what I said we needed yesterday to happen which was The Head and Shoulders we put our alarm at the shift of structure and once we body close under it we get the retest and then we sell that's basically it we' we've said it a 100 [ __ ] times you can't make this up dude you can not make this up okay so right now we are up exactly a 1 to 1 and we're up about 100,000 that means when we get to a 1 to two we we should be up 200,000 and when we get to a 1 the three we'll be up 300,000 isn't that beautiful don't you want to have your easy math like that every single time you add a risk for reward it's just an extra 100K 100K 100K sounds good to me this is why I didn't want to celebrate earlier or be anywhere near excited because I expected for something like this to happen we are currently down about $225,000 in the account when we were up earlier about 150,000 at that height of it the markets didy did the did out of me look at this price went not only straight into our stop loss but a complete violation break through the previous structure level almost through the screen and out the [ __ ] roof we just got Diddy DD in the didd is that even real [ __ ] luckily we did not risk much on the position we are only back at $135,000 and we only took about a $68,000 loss on the account which given this trade I should have risked 100% but I explain to you the higher I go in the account I lower my Risk by 25 to 50% so I'm not even mad I I I'm not it's just it's one of those losses with this type of approach you know Albert Einstein has projects that sometimes don't don't do well and right now we are not doing well we're still at the same exact spot still no new positions into the account so our trade ideas are going to potentially start moving as of right now GBP CHF for CS I love how this price action is currently looking right now daily time frame close with a daily dogee and if we go down to the 1 Hour 1 hour has had what looks to be like a little double top I'm literally going to wait for a break and retest under this area right here so this is kind of like the consolidation Zone it's in so I want to have some type of break out of this and then a quick retest to then sell a little break out then a quick retest to then sell everything depends on the price action but I want to enter here but I can't enter here right now I need to breakout confirmation and then the pull back to enter here I don't mind entering a little bit lower but I just need the confirmation that it's having a break on it's having a move we are up 200 and 38,000 [ __ ] dollars GBP C F trade update so right now we have three very unique entries on GBP CHF and I want to explain them to Perfection because this moved very fast literally only like 4 hours this is just one Candlestick so GBP CHF we had the 4-Hour bearish engulfing how I wanted from that area and then we obviously entered at the breakout of all of this consolidation Zone here I entered on this 1 in the morning Candlestick as it was getting ready to close entered right there spread took me a little bit down and then we add our next entry on this 15minute pullback so we had the full move I'm like yes amazing beautiful but then we had this pullback and on this pullback I waited for this engulfing confirmation we entered on this pullback of this Wick and then the next entry we entered at the bottom of that rejection candle right there and those are our three entries we have our first one up here our second right here and our third one right around here and our take profit was very strategically placed at this next 4our low so as you can see the 4 Hour is clearly bearish higher high higher low D bearish lower low lower high lower low lower high we're destined to create a new lower low but up to where up to this structure point and you can clearly see that price has very well reacted from that structure point this is only a 1 to 2.7 risk reward and we've risked a lot more than what we're risking here on different markets this move just happens to be very very volatile like we're up 102 Pips right now we got a sudden and forget the trade either hits my stop loss or hits my takeprofit and I sudden and forget and the trade ended up closing off at the highest point which I think it was about $400,000 at this point where the challenge is right now so we stuck to our trading plan we held oursel accountable while doing this live in front of hundreds of thousands of people on my telegram Discord Instagram YouTube absolutely everywhere I'm not the only one making money at this point there's so many of you guys that have done your own flips that I'm like oh [ __ ] this shit's getting serious I did a podcast with a student that by copying my exact same trades he took uh what was it I think he took $1,000 to $150,000 this guy by just watching my Instagram stories became a six figure person by watching 10sec Instagram stories talk about [ __ ] value trade update we closed at 332,000 trade history as you guys can see we have officially closed the position at the highest point keyw we've closed the position we were just up 400,000 we lost 70k just because of [ __ ] floating [ __ ] out well you know what we actually want to trade we shouldn't be doing that so after we closed off on week 12 at about $400,000 on week 13 I got a bright idea we're gonna [ __ ] live stream the last trade turning 400 into a million [ __ ] it I came up with a bright idea to do it on Instagram I go on Instagram try to do an IG live doesn't let me said okay you know what everything happens for a reason let's then go to YouTube and we start a live stream turning $400,000 to $800,000 all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to the live stream today in the morning when I I literally just woke up like an hour ago and I'm seeing the trade that I took last night I'm like yo I have to do an IG live from the moment that I wake up till this trade hits a million then I go to my Ig so I'm going to show you guys right now so this is my account as you guys can see when I go into my account I go into my settings and I'm trying to go on live so I'm I'm going to do it right now with you guys right so right here on my Ig I try and go live so I click here live at this time here accounts is not eligible to use this so even if I wanted to I couldn't go live on Instagram and I'm like [ __ ] how do I stream like for me this very point the whole entire way of me turning the 100 to the amount like it's going to literally be like the rawest day in the life that I think anybody has ever done so basically we're going to stream until this account turns into a MK whether it happens today tomorrow the day after I don't plan to turn off the stream until we don't reach the million so this can last an hour which I don't think so based off of the price action or this can last 24 hours this can last 48 hours I will not shut off this stream until we don't complete the challenge this is something that is legendary and that I want it to be documented the whole entire way so get prepared get comfortable cuz this is going to be an interesting 24hours 48 Hours you guys are going to see real day in my life obviously like if I had to enter some meetings and stuff you know I can't have you guys be part of that I just kind of like put it to the phone and [ __ ] so I mean s we're we're live bro like what do we do now like we're just live look this is literally live right now Focus how much are we up 600 [ __ ] yeah there you there you go history hold up is it focusing is it focusing yeah put a little higher yeah there you go you want it higher than that huh okay so basically we have USD CHF where basically we have been interested in taking this position since early this week you guys can tell how we've had this very strong consolidation Zone and then what we ended up doing is we broke out of that consolidation Zone let me actually take off all these writings so once we broke out of this consolidation Zone we were then waiting for price to have a retest of this area once it retested this structure then we would continue to head to the upside now this had the retest exactly not exactly as I wanted to but it made it to the area and we had the most important thing which is going to be our entry signal which is this right here this right here is our entry signal not this specifically but there's something in here that happened that is my entry signal and I don't really ever speak about it and you know what I'm going to talk about it on the stream but not right now cuz we just got started with the stream and I don't see this Market moving for the next 7 hours so only to the soldiers that are with me for these next seven hours that I'm doing this stream am I going to actually break everything down of my strategy and everything so I I I you know I feel like I came up with this idea and I haven't really processed that we didn't really put some bro for real dude what the [ __ ] bro cuz now I can't turn it off I just can't I'm so committed I I can't I live stream for literally 26 hours I was with you guys when I went to throw away trash when I went to go eat when I went to go drift when I went to go do my day-to-day life I literally was with you guys all the time so I did want to say this is probably one of the most spontaneous little events I've done I probably expected five people to pull up six people to up we have well over almost like 50 60 people it's 2:00 in the morning you guys are Maniacs right I'm telling you guys know I thought I was a freak staying up all night watching the markets are well clear I'm the only one I could be a maniac I could be a maniac but I'm not the only one I'm surrounded by other people that are passionate about this [ __ ] people that are willing to do whatever the [ __ ] it takes to make this [ __ ] go down and like yeah it's cool that I you know dropped the pin and was able to get you guys here together but like this [ __ ] is not about me bro like this this is about you guys you guys got to realize that you guys are doing the same thing that I'm doing to be able to be on the same Journey that I am you guys are staying up you guys are putting money at risk you guys are learning failing rinse and repeating and over time you're not the same person that you were last month compared to now so I just want to say like the people that you are around right now are the people you want to be around with you're the fifth person out of the four people in your friend group if your four friends are smoking weed you're [ __ ] smoking weed if your four friends are Diddy you're the fit Diddy how it go you guys were telling me to close the trade when we were up 700,000 this is not done there's a lot more in this you guys told me to close the trade when price started pulling back and we were at 600,000 and on the live stream not only am I answering all your guys' questions but I am literally engraving the mindset you need to adapt to be able to handle these types of swings the trade isn't done if the trade is not hit the take profit you do not close the trade was at about 700,000 and I wish you could see the chat literally thousands of people live watching saying close close close close clearly none of these people are my students and they don't know how the set and forget strategy works the set and forget strategy works by set and forgetting you have a stop- loss you have a take profit price is either going to hit one or the other and guess what we did we set him [ __ ] forget we have officially closed the challenge 800,000 just do it the trade not only hit our takeprofit and we close at 800,000 the trade continued to create new highs if I would have just continued to hold for two more hours I would have completely finished the challenge at this very moment I could have finished it on a legendary 26-hour stream but you know what I'm glad that I followed my strategy and I closed at where I did because then this gave me the opportunity on week 14 to start off a stream right at the beginning of the week where then we took the final $800,000 to then the million and all I can say you know what I'm going to let the stream speak for itself and you know what I think my celebration was a little extra I can't even lie but how would you feel after you turned the $100 into a million I think you'll be excited right now my yeah and on both streams I'm talking about stream one where we stream for 26 hours and on stream to on week 14 I was letting everybody know that once I completed the challenge I wasn't just going to stop there I knew that once I would complete the challenge I was going to be bored because achieving the challenge is cool it's showing people that it could be done but it doesn't show you guys the how so I came up with the bright idea that if I complete this 100 to the mill series I am going to open a 30-day boot camp I'm going to open 300 new spots to take on Traders literally from Level zero to 100 to replicate the exact same thing that I did where I'm going to teach my most lated and updated version of my strategy on how exactly I turned 100 to the maill I can teach anybody I'm talking about your grandma that doesn't know anything about trading to an experience Trader that is having some type of profits but not the type that he wants get him from literally level 0 to 100 to trade just like me and have the same results as me so this is where I came up with the 30-day boot camp and it's literally my third time doing this and the results of the students that are part of this boot camp are literally unheard of students that have literally known nothing from trading in their first six months they make their first payout and even first six figures you can take Jay and juice for example you can take Mike where Mike took $1,000 in his first four months of trading after the boot camp he turned it into $120,000 so this 30-day boot camp is now going to be your journey of the 100 to the mail I'm going to literally show these 300 new students that I personally can select how to replicate exactly what I did I'm going to take you from Level zero to 100 and even if let's say you're at level 70 or if you think you are I have to reteach you how to read I have to retach you how to read the markets so you can read them exactly how I do and you can apply the exact strategy on how I do it and this is the beauty of the set and for guet strategy it is so simple to learn and have results that I've had hundreds of students all around the world have results just like mine not only by copying and being part of my journey but then finding their own markets and them being able to do it for themselves which honestly it's the best feeling ever so the hundreds of the mil challenge was completed but it doesn't end there now Begins the next challenge the 30-day boot camp boot camp is literally ridiculous but truthfully I can't teach everybody that wants to be part of the 30-day boot camp I have to limit it to a certain amount of Traders because I want to give quality to the people that deserve it so if you want to be part of this 30-day boot camp you have to apply there's no way of you joining if you do not apply to the 30-day boot camp I want to review your application the effort and the time that you put into your application is the same exact time and effort that I'm going to put into reviewing your application and deciding if I'm going to accept these new students or not because truthfully this is my second mic drop in the industry the first one is I completed the challenge big mic drop did it live on a stream with absolutely everybody watching the before during the after of every single trade but now it's my time to put time into you guys the 100 to the mail I did it for myself and my own game yes I turned the 100 into the mail cool but that doesn't really do anything for you guys you guys don't really capitalize off of it unless you were copying all the trades and Me part of the journey those you guys that couldn't because of work because of your time because you just weren't able to tune in every single day to the trades i s in my telegram Instagram YouTube this is what this 30-day boot camp is for so you can learn the strategy and you be able to implement it yourself and you have your own journey and make trading your new source of income in this upcoming year so if you want to be part of this 30-day boot camp and have the same exact results as students like J and juice or Mike make sure you apply to the 30-day boot camp I'm going to review your application and decide if you get accepted or not because truthfully I'm ready to now take on this new challenge and have the second biggest mic drop in the industry by taking the biggest amount of traders that I personally can manage to take them from Level zero to 100 and make trading their new source of income in this upcoming year so truthfully all I can say is whenever in doubt set and forget thank you guys for watching the whole entire 100 to the mill series I'm very very very very proud of all of you guys that stayed tuned throughout the whole entire Journey everything that you guys learned thank you guys for supporting and being there with me for this journey but this chapter has now ended and I have just opened a new one with these 300 new students I'll see the 300 new students on the 30-day boot camp when we begin you guys want to be part of it make sure you guys apply below and all I can say is I and forget
